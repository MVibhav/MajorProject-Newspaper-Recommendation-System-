As per depositories data, FPIs took out Rs 3,627 crore from equities, Rs 3,173 crore from debt segment and Rs 34 crore from hybrid instruments.
Previously, FPIs have been net sellers for fourth consecutive months.
""FPIs have sharply increased the pace of selling after the US Fed announcement last week in which it indicated an end of the ultra-loose monetary policy regime,"" said Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director - Manager Research, Morningstar India.
Besides, globally, the bond yields have surged in the recent times on expectation of a hike in interest rates by the US Fed, he added.
This has made investors risk averse prompting them to cut exposure in riskier assets and move towards safe havens such as gold.
""On the domestic front, the pro-growth budget did manage to check the exodus of funds to some extent. However, the wider effect of budget on foreign flows would be clear in the coming weeks,"" he further added.
Despite the recent correction in the markets, Indian equities continue to tread at elevated levels.
With current global backdrop, FIIs have been moving out to the markets which have rich valuations and investing in the ones offering relatively attractive valuation and better risk-reward, as per Srivastava.
""FPIs sold heavily in banks and IT and were buyers in metals,"" noted V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.
For the future of FPI investment, Shrikant Chouhan, Head - Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities said ""equity markets is expected to remain volatile, given the high inflation and Fed's expected to increase the interest rate in the coming month... With higher inflation and rising bond yields, FPI flows in India are likely to remain volatile."""

"If cos have views on Chairperson, MD posts separation, Sebi should hear them: FM",https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/if-cos-have-views-on-chairperson--md-posts-separation--sebi-should-hear-them--fm.html,"Sunday, 06 February 2022",PTI,Business," As Sebi plans to implement norms for separation of posts of Chairperson and MD of listed companies, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the regulator should also hear if Indian companies have a view on the matter even as she made it clear that she was not ""giving a diktat"".
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked listed entities to split the roles of chairperson and managing director before the April 2022 deadline.
It is to be noted that financial sector regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has implemented this in the banking sector a few years ago.           Listed entities were initially required to separate the roles of chairperson and MD/CEO from April 1, 2020 onwards. However, based on industry representations, an additional time period of two years was given for compliance.
On issue of split of CMD position, Sitharaman said, ""I had reviewed it with Sebi. Some good number of companies has followed it...This norm was brought in by Sebi four years ago.    It was one of the global best practices and introduced with the aim of moving towards best practices so that companies are professionally run, she said.
""But I do agree that the way Indian companies are run and built over the decade and over century also depends so much on the family and related members being on the board.
""So, I am of the view that Sebi— which is an independent regulator...I am not giving them diktat — I am voicing my view— I think if Indian companies have a view then Sebi should also hear them. I will leave it there and I hope that it indicates where I am coming from. This should be giving you some breath of fresh air and moment to heave a sigh of relief. So let's see and I will leave it there,"" she said.
At the end of December 2020, 53 per cent of the top 500 listed entities had complied with this provision.              Currently, many companies have merged the two posts as CMD (chairman-cum-managing director), leading to some overlapping of the board and management, which could lead to conflict of interest and consequently the regulator in May 2018, came out with its norms to split the post.
The norms were part of the series of recommendations given by the Sebi-appointed Uday Kotak committee on corporate governance.
On the scrappage policy, Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said, there should be some concrete action on that in the next few months.               Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August 2021 launched the national vehicle scrappage policy and had said it will help phase out unfit and polluting vehicles and also promote a circular economy.

Budget 2023 more directional with long-term growth: Goyal,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/budget-2023-more-directional-with-long-term-growth--goyal.html,"Sunday, 06 February 2022",Agencies,Business,"Stating that the budget 2023 is more directional with a quarter of a century of sustained growth in mind, Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday sought to deflect criticism in certain quarters that the government focused more on the supply-side than on growth-boosting demand side of the economy. 
 On February 1, the government presented a budget with no tax increases and thus no new revenue generation measures but chose to do record borrowings to fund a budgeted 35 per cent increased capital investment at ` 7.5 lakh crore and also offered an additional ` 1 lakh crore to the states for capital investment in interest-free loans.
Together with the states, the overall capital expenditure next fiscal will be at a record high of Rs 10.5 lakh crore.
This will have the government borrowing hitting a historic high with gross borrowing at `14.95 lakh crore and net borrowing of `11.6 lakh crore.
 Demand has been the biggest missing link in the economy even before the pandemic hit the nation and scuppered the last strain of demand as those who had money chose to save and not splurge while tens of millions became jobless."
FM exhorts India Inc to open up their purse for sustained growth,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/fm-exhorts-india-inc-to-open-up-their-purse-for-sustained-growth.html,"Sunday, 06 February 2022",PTI,Business,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday exhorted India Inc to take advantage of announcements made in Budget and ""quickly"" step up capex so that the virtuous cycle of investment gathers momentum.
Addressing members of CII, she said increase in capex in the Budget was done with twin objectives of supporting sustained growth and crowd in private investment.
 She asserted that this is the right time for investment and industry should not lose this opportunity. 
""Post the pandemic with all the reshuffling happening, reset happening in the ways in which you do your business and also with that step of October 2019 in which that one condition was please start reducing by March 2023 is also now extended by one more year,"" she said.
 The Budget 2022-23 presented on February 1 proposed that the concessional 15 per cent corporate tax rate would be available for one more year till March 2024 for newly incorporated manufacturing units.
 The Government in September 2019 slashed corporate tax rate for  companies that do not avail of any tax incentive, to 22 per cent.  New manufacturing companies have to pay at an even lower corporate  tax rate of 15 per cent.
 The Government slashed corporate tax rate to provide incentive for the private sector to ramp up investment which was muted for last few years. However, this got further aggravated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Stressing that many sectors have been opened up, she said, there are immense opportunities in the sunrise sectors and New Age sectors like bulk drugs vaccines, and genome.
 ""Do sit back and calmly take a call. India needs all the expansion in capacity and it is that which is going to kick off the virtuous cycle.
 ""I would just want to green flag those areas before you and call upon the industry to quickly join and help the virtuous cycle to gain traction. The government has not given up its investment in infrastructure and that's going to have a bearing on the core industries directly and soon,"" she said.
 The government has hiked public investment by as much as 35.4 per cent to `7.5 lakh crore or 2.9 per cent of the GDP in the Budget 2023-24.
 She urged industry not to lose this opportunity for India to reach a higher level of industrialization and manufacturing in India.     The global arena is getting opened up where global value chains are not going to be concentrated in one geography but are relocating to countries with rule of law and English speaking people.
 ""India fits into that very well and industry should take advantage of this global shift,"" she added.
 Speaking on the issue of rural distress, she said, that the same was being addressed in multiple ways. The budget has enabled access to tractors and other farm equipment through rentals as well as making credit available.
 The government has ensured availability of nutrients and fertilisers at affordable prices, despite the increase in global prices, she said, adding, multiple welfare schemes have provided support for housing, cooking gas, electricity, healthcare etc.       "

RBI may hike reverse repo rate by 0.25 pc in next week's policy: Report,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/rbi-may-hike-reverse-repo-rate-by-0-25-pc-in-next-week-s-policy--report.html,"Friday, 04 February 2022",PTI,Business,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) may go for a hike of up to 0.25 per cent in the reverse repo rate at which the RBI absorbs excess liquidity and leave the repo rate at which it lends, to narrow the policy rate corridor, a British brokerage said on Thursday.
""Growth concerns amid spread of the Omicron variant and relatively benign inflation out-turns provide the RBI with enough room to maintain its growth-supportive monetary policies,"" analysts at Barclays said, ahead of the resolution announcement next week.
The RBI will hike the reverse repo rate by 0.20-0.25 per cent, given its liquidity management actions, it said.
The brokerage joins a growing list of watchers expecting a reverse repo hike. Other analysts also blame the surprising hike in the government borrowing announced in the budget for the RBI's likely call for policy normalisation.
Barclays said the budget's focus on capital expenditure is expected to provide a back-loaded fiscal impulse to the economy and does not change the macro backdrop, which includes concerns on inflation.
On the surging global oil prices, which generally play into domestic inflation through corresponding price hikes of fuels locally, the brokerage said the inflationary pressures are unlikely to rise before the state elections finish by March, hinting of no pass-through.
Even though the inflation is benign lately, the RBI needs to be vigilant, it said, pointing to its own forecasts suggesting the headline number staying in the upper end of the 2-6 per cent band and also the crude prices moving higher.
It said till now, the liquidity signals from the RBI have been mixed, which have included shelving of the bond purchasing programme GSAP, an increase in both the quantum and cut-offs for voluntary reverse repo rate auctions and some bond sales in the secondary market last month.

India's services sector activity slips further in Jan,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/india-s-services-sector-activity-slips-further-in-jan.html,"Friday, 04 February 2022",PTI,Business,"India's services sector activity moderated further in January as new business rose at a noticeably slower rate amid the escalation of the pandemic, reintroduction of restrictions and inflationary pressures, a monthly survey said on Thursday.
The seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index fell to 51.5 in January, down from 55.5 in December, pointing to the slowest rate of expansion in the current six-month sequence of growth.
For the sixth straight month, the services sector witnessed an expansion in output. In Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below 50 denotes contraction.
According to survey participants, demand was restricted by the fast spread of the Omicron variant and the reinstatement of curfews in parts of the country.
""The escalation of the pandemic and reintroduction of curfews had a detrimental impact on growth across the service sector. Both new business and output rose at slight rates that were the weakest in six months,"" Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.
Companies became increasingly worried that growth would be harmed by the intensification of the pandemic, reintroduction of restrictions and inflationary pressures. Business sentiment remained positive but slipped to a six-month low.
""Concerns about how long the current wave of COVID-19 will last dampened business confidence and caused job shedding. Firms were also alarmed about price pressures,"" Lima noted.
Service sector jobs declined for the second month running during January, owing to reduced output requirements among some businesses and future uncertainty.
Meanwhile, the Composite PMI Output Index -- which measures combined services and manufacturing output -- fell from 56.4 in December to 53.0 in January, signalling the slowest rate of expansion in the current six-month period of growth. Services activity and manufacturing production increased at weaker rates.
The January data pointed to a second successive monthly drop in private sector employment. Despite being modest, the rate of job shedding accelerated from December, the survey said.
On the price front, the January data pointed to a stronger increase in expenses among service providers, with the overall rate of inflation climbing to its highest since December 2011. Survey members said there were higher food, fuel, material, staff and transportation costs.
""The latest PMI results brought worrying news as input prices increased at the sharpest rate in over a decade. Charges rose at a faster pace as some firms continued to transfer additional cost burdens to consumers, but the rate of inflation here was moderate as the vast majority of monitored companies left their fees unchanged since December,"" Lima said. Meanwhile, the monetary policy committee of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is slated to announce its policy on February 9.

Expressing gratitude to the President for taking note of the good work done by the KVIC, Saxena said the Commission  built several monumental Charkhas to propagate Gandhian thoughts and symbolism of Charkha in India and abroad which further popularized Khadi..
Khadi’s success was acknowledged by the  President in his address to the Parliament on January 312, and by  Home Minister  Amit Shah, a day before at Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad, while unveiling Mahatma Gandhi’s 100 sq meter wall mural on his 74th Martyr’s Day.
“Khadi and Gandhi were only used for political gains. It was only after the year 2014, that concrete efforts were made by the Narendra Modi government to popularize Khadi and spread the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi and the symbolism of Charkha across the globe. Be it the birth anniversary or the martyrdom of Mahatma Gandhi, KVIC organized unique programs to celebrate Gandhian thoughts,” he said, adding.” The PM himself is the biggest  source of inspiration behind the success of KVIC.”
During the last 7 years, KVIC built monuments like world’s biggest wooden and steel charkhas, world’s smallest charkha on wrist watches, Gandhi ji’s world’s largest wall mural made of clay Kulhads, world’s largest national flag made of Khadi fabric, heritage Charkha museum and many more.

Domestic two-wheeler sales dip 21 pc in Jan; recovery likely in coming months,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/domestic-two-wheeler-sales-dip-21-pc-in-jan--recovery-likely-in-coming-months.html,"Thursday, 03 February 2022",PNS,Business,"The domestic two-wheeler sales witnessed a 21 per cent year-on-year decline in January, even as the segment registered a 14 per cent sequential growth in domestic wholesale volumes, while the passenger vehicle wholesale volumes declined marginally by 3 per cent Y-o-Y, credit ratings agency ICRA said on Wednesday.
The two-wheeler sales numbers are based on the data released by six major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), ICRA said in a statement.
In January 2022, domestic wholesale PV volumes at 2.95 Lakh units represented around 16 per cent growth on a sequential basis and only a marginal decline of 3 per cent on Y-o-Y basis, said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, Vice President and Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited.
The lower production levels over the months have led to unusually high waiting periods for many high-selling models, with waiting periods for select models being as high as 6-8 months, he said. 
The low year-on-year two-wheeler sales volume in January, highlights the adverse impact of price hikes, fuel inflation, and Omicron-related concerns on consumer sentiments, Gupta stated.
Noting that the supply chain issues in production of premium motorcycles also persisted, he said, the reinstatement of localised restrictions, to contain the third wave of pandemic, constrained retail sales and led to an 11 per cent sequential (14 per cent year-on-year) fall in volumes, to 10.2 lakh units.
Nonetheless, the industry is cautiously optimistic about recovery in coming months, with easing supply chain constraints and spillover impact from positive announcements on infrastructure spends and agri-initiatives in the Union Budget, Gupta stated.
In contrast to the domestic sales environment, steady demand from African and Latin America (LATAM) regions continued to be the silver lining for the industry, with exports clocking steady volumes of over 3.5 lakh units in January 2022, registering a 3 per cent sequential growth, according to ICRA.
Gupta also noted that the domestic electric two-wheeler sales continued to have a dream-run in the April-January period of FY2022, posting a 5 times year-on-year growth at 1.49 lakh unit sales.
In January 2022, the high-speed e-two-wheelers saw an 11 per cent month-on-month growth with 27,563 unit sales (highest monthly sales this year), Gupta said.

Design-led scheme for 5G ecosystem to pitch India as manufacturing hub: Industry,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/design-led-scheme-for-5g-ecosystem-to-pitch-india-as-manufacturing-hub--industry.html,"Wednesday, 02 February 2022",PTI,Business,"Government's push on fiberisation and technology will spur connectivity, while the design-led scheme announced in the Budget for 5G ecosystem will bolster India's position as a manufacturing hub, telecom industry said on Tuesday.
Budget announcements including those around 5G spectrum auction and 100 per cent fiberisation with PPP model would provide the required impetus to accelerate ubiquitous and reliable internet connectivity, Nitin Bansal, managing director, India and Head-Networks - Southeast Asia, Oceania and India at Ericsson, said.
HFCL Ltd managing director Mahendra Nahata said the expected spectrum rollout for 5G in 2022, combined with the scheme for design-led manufacturing for 5G equipment under the PLI scheme will not only lead to sectoral advancements but also spur job opportunities.
""...We are delighted to hear that contracts for laying optical fibre in villages will be awarded under BharatNet project under PPP model in 2022-23. This will help the telecom industry in providing affordable broadband and mobile communication in rural and remote areas,"" Nahata observed.         Prashant Singhal, TMT (Technology, Media, Telecom) Emerging Markets Leader, EY, noted that allocating 5 per cent of annual USOF collection will significantly bolster rural connectivity.
""Strengthening of the BharatNet infrastructure through PPP model will enhance the connectivity backbone of an increasingly digital nation. Globally, 200 telcos in 78 countries have already launched commercial 5G services,"" he said.
According to Singhal, a clear focus on 5G spectrum auctions and rollout will help India to catch up with the rest of the world.                 The budget announcement has given much-needed push for 5G, Singhal said adding government's move to launch a design-led manufacturing scheme will help to position India as a hub for 5G equipment manufacturing and exports.
Sterlite Technologies' (STL) managing director Ankit Agarwal believes that budget will accelerate India's digital ambitions.               
""...It sets the foundation for India's 5G readiness through spectrum auctions, R&D impetus, USOF allocation along with a boost for domestic manufacturing through a timely 'Design-led manufacturing' scheme,"" Agarwal said.
As per Deloitte India, Partner and telecom sector leader, Peeyush Vaish, the PLI scheme extension to 5G rollout and the commitment on fibre in all villages by 2025 will give an additional thrust to investment in new technologies in the telecom sector.
Telecom Sector Skill Council, CEO, Arvind Bali, said the announcement of spectrum auction in 2022 for 5G rollout and the scheme for design-led manufacturing is likely to ""uplift"" human resource requirements significantly as also the need to train the existing and new

A family is happy when every member carries out his duties, he said, adding that similarly, under Gati Shakti, 16 departments have been tied together so that each fulfils its responsibilities and uses resources judiciously to achieve its targets.
The National Master Plan will have a multiplier effect on the lives of people, the Minister noted. He said words like ""gati"" (speed) and ""shakti"" (strength) have been added to the country's dictionary after a gap of 70 years.
The investments made by the United States in multi-modal logistics in the last 100 years has turned it into a super power, Scindia said.""If we could bring all 36 States to work together and if we could develop coordination so that there is no delay in getting the requisite permissions, we will be able to achieve the aim of multi-modal connectivity,"" he added.

How Zaakpay is Empowering Businesses to Succeed with Digital Payments in Today's Age?,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/zaakpay-s-role-in-empowering-businesses.html,"Monday, 31 January 2022",Agencies,Business,"Whether you are a startup or an SME, you want to provide your consumers the ability to make payments quickly and safely. There is a growing number of clients who make payments through Credit Card, Debit Card, or other means. The dependence of people on digital and cashless transactions has made merchants aware of what their customers want from them. In today's digital age, businesses must make critical decisions relating to which mode of payment they should allow for their customers.
Your choice of a payment gateway directly impacts your business's ability to develop. Therefore, selecting the most suitable one must be on top of your list. In India, Zaakpay is one of the most popular payment processors used by merchants and businesses alike. Several small, medium and large enterprises rely on this revolutionary payment gateway. In this article, you will learn how Zaakpay facilitates companies with the tools they need to accept digital payments in the modern world successfully.
Zaakpay's Role in Empowering Businesses
High Success Rate in Transactions: Successful transactions are critical for small firms to flourish. Startups in India face a lot of friction when it comes to making an impact on customers and obtaining a strong market hold. Compared to more established companies, client loss because of a non-payment is particularly damaging to a startup's prospects for growth. Zaakpay, on the other hand, has a 99.9% system uptime rate and a very good success rate among the finest payment gateways, making it an excellent choice for startups. Customers are more likely to make online purchases from the retailer when they are sure that their payments will go through without any hindrances.
Zaakpay's Two-Fold Benefit: Merchants that use Zaakpay have reported receiving payments faster than they would with other payment gateways. Small, medium and large organizations can enjoy a greater success rate with Zaakpay. A better shopping experience for your clients and a steady flow of revenue are additional benefits if you opt for Zaakpay. You won't have to wait longer for clients since payments are approved in a matter of seconds.
Security is also a major concern for Zaakpay. To provide the greatest level of security, the payment gateway adheres to globally recognized standards such as PCI DSS compliance and SSL encrypted safe servers. High-tech security measures such as two-factor authentication, one-time password verifications, and card-on-file tokenization are being used to verify Zaakpay payments further. Your startup's customers will be more likely to buy from you if they feel safe making payments, thanks to this level of protection.
Cost-Effectiveness: To help your small company flourish, Zaakpay offers reasonable pricing and high transaction success rates. With Zaakpay payment gateway, you can enjoy the lowest Transaction Discount Rate, starting at 0%*. In addition, your clients won't be surprised by any additional fees as their payment method if they use Zaakpay. Custom payment gateway costs may also be arranged for your startup needs. In addition, there are no setup or maintenance expenses with Zaakpay.
  Multiple Payment Modes: In the checkout area, a potential consumer becomes a paying customer. Companies have a severe issue when customers leave their shopping carts due to unsuitable or fewer payment choices. Customer cart abandonment occurs when the customer's preferred payment method is not available. This harms the growth of your startup and weakens your customer base. Zaakpay, on the other hand, gives you a slew of payment possibilities. Zaakpay offers more than 100 methods of payment, including Debit Cards, Credit Cards, eWallets, Net Banking, UPI, and so on. For small businesses with an extensive consumer base, Zaakpay is the most suitable payment gateway.
  Growth Tracking: With the added advantage of Zaakpay's merchant dashboard, business owners can examine their invoices and other financial information relating to their business. Aside from tracking sales, they can make use of this data to determine how well the firm is doing on the basis of frequency and location of online payments. The information that is accessible on the dashboard reports is designed to help merchants foresee and prepare for future decision-making. This unique feature also allows merchants to produce appropriate records straight from the statements issued by the dashboard. As a result, maintaining finances becomes even more simplified since the possibility of human errors gets eliminated.
  Customer Service: Zaakpay provides a 24/7 email support service for both company owners as well as consumers. Your customers would experience a boost of confidence when they are sure about their problems and issues being resolved with patience. They would be more than willing to become loyal customers knowing they can turn to you at any moment with concerns about a failed transaction or for any other help that may be needed.
  Streamlined Checkout Process: Every business owner wants to provide the best experience for their customers, especially at the time of checkouts. If consumers need to go through several confusing platforms to complete their payment process, they are more likely to give up on the transaction and abandon the cart. With Zaakpay, you don’t face this issue as it streamlines the whole checkout process with little effort and extremely quick processing.
  Startups Privileges: Startups are welcome to take advantage of extra perks when they join ‘Zaakpay for Startups’. These include several benefits such as an Rs. 10,00,000 reward, priority onboarding assistance, promotion via social media, and mentoring sessions. Get a head start on your flourishing business with Zaakpay, and soar to new heights.
Internet payments have grown in popularity since the beginning of online commerce. Payment gateways and online payment options have become commonplace for many companies. Customers and merchants benefit from an excellent payment gateway, which provides a quick and straightforward payment procedure. In India, Zaakpay has become one of the most popular payment gateways. This has made it a great option for small, medium and large businesses. The reason behind this is its low fees and a customer-focused approach."
Factors to Pay Attention while Choosing Car Insurance,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/factors-to-pay-attention-while-choosing-car-insurance.html,"Monday, 31 January 2022",Agencies,Business,"If you’ve recently purchased your dream four-wheeler or are in the process of buying one, have you taken out the time to think about the car insurance you’ll be moving forward with? Choosing the right car insurance takes as much time, and due diligence as picking the right car does. Moreover, you cannot take your vehicle on the Indian roads without valid, active car insurance. If you’re ever caught driving an uninsured vehicle, you will be charged with heavy fines and penalties by the concerned authorities. 
When something is so important, it becomes crucial to pay special attention to it. If you’ve begun the search for car insurance, but are not sure how to pick the best option, consider the following factors to ensure you get the ideal insurance for your vehicle.

1.     Choose the Ideal Type of Car Insurance from the List Below:
The search for the perfect car insurance starts with understanding your requirements. Decide what you want and then proceed to take a pick from the following:
●      Third-Party Car Insurance:
Third party car insurance is the most basic insurance type that vehicle owners are mandated to have by law. This insurance secures car owners against any financial damages caused to third-party properties and third-party individuals during a road accident. A downside of third-party insurance is that it does not cover losses caused to the vehicle owner during a road accident.

●      Comprehensive Car Insurance:
If you want better coverage, proceed with comprehensive car insurance. This insurance covers the policy owner against third-party financial losses and own damages, providing better coverage and security. You can also enhance the security by opting for specific add-ons you feel can improve the policy coverage.
●      Own Damage Car Insurance:
If you want to cover damages caused to you and your car alone, you must opt for own damage car insurance coverage.  Own Damage Insurance is a customized motor insurance policy designed to protect you and your insured vehicle from your own damages, mainly of damages and losses caused to your own vehicle. This particular insurance policy also covers damages caused due to natural calamities, road mishaps, etc.
Even though own-damage car insurance is a standalone policy, its functionalities come to a better use when you have third-party insurance by its side. Therefore, it is advisable to have a third-party insurance and then opt for an own damage car insurance policy.

2.     Check the Insured Declared Value (IDV)
A vehicle’s car insurance premium is greatly influenced by its IDV. For the uninitiated, the Insured Declared Value (IDV) is the vehicle’s current market value. Like other tangible assets, even cars depreciate in value due to natural wear and tear, ultimately reducing their market value.
Some tend to confuse IDV with the vehicle’s current resale value, so make sure you don’t fall into this confusion. IDV is just the vehicle’s current market value and not resale value. While booking insurance, digital insurers allow you to select your car’s IDV from a given range. Always remember that the higher the car’s IDV, the higher the premium, and vice-versa. 
3.     Look for Claim Procedure & Approval Reviews
The very reason to get car insurance is to get hassle-free and quick assistance from the insurer. You wouldn’t want yourself going through a complex, time-consuming claim process after having met with an accident. So before shortlisting any insurance, always check the insurer’s claim procedure and approval reviews online.
Genuine reviews from real customers can help you a lot in picking a reliable insurance partner. You can join Facebook groups, subreddits, forums, or other online communities built around insurance to easily find, connect, and ask questions about claim procedure and approval reviews from people who’ve had an association with the particular insurance company.
4.     Compare Similar Policies from Other Insurers
Once you’re clear about your requirements, you should start looking for at least two to three policies from different insurers. The more options you compare, the closer you’ll get to the ideal policy. Luckily, comparing policies is not that hard. You can look for websites that compare different car insurance plans from various insurance companies or create exhaustive online resources around car insurance plans that are enough to help you make a decision.
You can also consider taking the help of online insurance premium calculators to understand how much premium you’ll end up paying for the type of car insurance you choose. These calculators also make policy comparisons an easy task, so make sure you use them during your research phase.

5.     Check the list of Add-ons Being Offered
Add-ons, also known as riders, are purchased separately to enhance the coverage of a selected policy. Though not all the policies offered by various insurers will have the same add-ons, some of the standard riders that you can find include:
Ø  Zero Depreciation Cover: An add-on that ensures the final settlement is calculated on the original value and not depreciated value.
Ø  Engine Protection Cover: This add-on covers the damages caused to the engine and gearbox due to oil leakage, water damage, etc.
Ø  Roadside Assistance: It helps significantly when a vehicle breaks down on the road and needs immediate roadside repair assistance.
Ø  Consumable Cover: This rider covers your car’s consumables like oil, nuts, bolts, screws, etc.
Ø  Return to Invoice Cover: An add-on that ensures you get an ex-showroom price of your car and not IDV if it gets stolen or damaged beyond repair.
Ø  Tyre Protection Cover: This add-on covers your car tyres against losses arising from tyre bursts, cuts, bulges, etc. Tyres aren’t covered in any standard car insurance and need separate protection.  So if you’re purchasing own-damage car insurance, you might want to purchase this rider along with a few others for better coverage.
Purchase only those add-ons that are needed as each add-on will increase your premium amount.
6.     Ask About Voluntary Deductibles
Once an insurance company approves the filed claim, they pay a significant part of the claimed amount. The balance amount is paid by the insured, which is called a deductible. If you agree to pay a higher deductible, the insurance company might reduce your premium. To calculate an approximate amount you’ll be able to comfortably pay to cover for losses from road mishaps and propose them a higher deductible accordingly. 
7.     Double-check the Inclusions & Exclusions
Not all four-wheeler insurance policies are created equal, so a wise step is to double-check the list of inclusions and exclusions explicitly mentioned in the policy document. For example, just because you’re purchasing standard car insurance doesn’t mean it will cover your car tyres.
If you want those covered, you’ll have to buy an add-on for them. There are various other things that are usually not covered in standard car insurance, so it’s best to clearly check what is covered and what is not, instead of assuming it covers everything. It will save you from unpleasant shockers during claim settlement.
8.     Choose Policies where Premiums are Affordable
Don’t choose a policy with a higher premium that you cannot comfortably pay. Use online premium calculators to find a car insurance policy that offers decent coverage and comes with affordable premiums.
It will ensure you don’t end up missing a timely premium payment. Even a single lag in premium payment can prevent you from getting the No Claim bonus benefits and even affect your insurance portability request at a future date.
9.     Understand the Insurance Terminologies
Before you start searching for car insurance, get acquainted with insurance terminologies. It will help you better understand all the car insurance plans you have to review, assisting you in making the right decision.
Some of the terms you should clearly understand are IDV, deductibles, no claim bonus, etc. A quick online search will show you the complete list of insurance terminologies along with their meaning in layman’s terms for better understanding, so do check it out. 
If you consider all the factors discussed-above while picking car insurance, your chances of making any mistake will be avoided.

V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said: ""There are three trends in the market which are important from investors' perspective. One, relentless massive selling by FIIs (around Rs 33,000 crore so far in January) is emerging as the strongest headwind to the market in the short-run.""
""Two, there is massive churn happening within the Nifty from tech to banking and to a lesser extent to autos. Three, over-valued growth stocks are getting punished and their valuations are slowly getting to realistic levels,"" he added.

Air India comes with over 140 aircraft but no real estate assets for Tata Sons,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/air-india-comes-with-over-140-aircraft-but-no-real-estate-assets-for-tata-sons.html,"Friday, 28 January 2022",IANS,Business,"Tata Sons subsidiary Talace, which took over the managerial control of Air India on Thursday, will get more than 140 aircraft and eight logos, among other assets such as human resources.

However, the transaction does not include non-core assets, including land and building, valued at Rs 14,718 crore, which are to be transferred to government of India's Air India Asset Holding Limited (AIAHL).

Besides, Tatas will also not get the world-famous art collection of Air India.

Nevertheless, the group will get Air India's 117 wide-body and narrow body aircraft apart from 24 aircraft of Air India Express. A significant number of these aircraft are owned by Air India.

It will also get to operate these aircraft on over 4,000 domestic and 1,800 international routes.

Also, eight brand logos would be transferable to the Tatas, which they have to retail for a period of five years.

As far as revenues are concerned, more than two-third of Air India's consolidated revenues come from the international market. The airline is still the largest player from India in the international market, having a strong footprint across geographies like North America, Europe and Middle East, with attractive slots and bilateral rights.

Additionally, Air India comes with a frequent flyer programme which has more than three million members.

In terms of manpower, the conglomerate will get the total talent pool of Air India and Air India Express, which stands at over 13,000, including permanent as well as contractual employees.

Under the agreement with the Centre, no employee will be removed for one-year. In the second year, if an employee has to be removed, a VRS option will be provided.

The employees will be provided gratuity, provident fund and post-retirement medical benefits.

Financially, Tatas will retain a debt of Rs 15,300 crore. It had to pay Rs 2,700 crore to the Centre as the cash component.

In addition, Tatas will need to take care of the Rs 20 crore loss per day that the company suffers.

There is also a three-year business continuity clause in the agreement.

Tatas would also need to maintain 51 per cent stake in the airline for at least one-year.

Tata to get loans from SBI-led consortium for AI,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/tata-to-get-loans-from-sbi-led-consortium-for-ai.html,"Friday, 28 January 2022",PTI,Business,"A consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India (SBI) will soon provide loans to Tata Group for the operations of Air India as well as to retire the airline's high cost borrowings.
After nearly 70 years, Tata Group on Thursday regained ownership of Air India. With the completion of the deal, the group will own 100 per cent stake in Air India, Air India Express and a 50 per cent shareholding in AISATS.
Bankers said the SBI-led consortium has agreed to grant both term loans and working capital loans depending on the airline's requirements.
All large lenders, including Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, and Union Bank of India, are part of the consortium, they added.
""Many banks have agreed for refinancing of Air Inida debt to Tatas and the process has begun,"" one of the bankers said. Existing lenders who do not wish to participate in refinancing of debt to Tatas will get their money repaid through the refinanced amount, the banker said.
Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is among the entities that had given loans earlier to loss-making Air India. Now, the IPO-bound LIC has decided not to extend more loans to the airline and will not participate in the current funding round led by the SBI, the bankers said.
Talace Private Limited -- a subsidiary of the Tata Group's holding company Tata Sons -- on October 8, 2021, won the bid to acquire debt-ridden Air India. It had offered Rs 18,000 crore, including cash of Rs 2,700 crore which has now been paid to the government.
The term loans to Talace will help in retiring the high cost borrowings of Air India, the bankers said.
The amount of loans likely to be extended by the consortium could not be immediately ascertained.
""The strategic disinvestment transaction of Air India successfully concluded today with transfer of 100 per cent shares of Air India to M/s talace Pvt Ltd along with management control,"" DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said in a tweet on Thursday.               "
20 years later: India's CPSE privatisation off to ‘Maharaja' start,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/20-years-later--india-s-cpse-privatisation-off-to----maharaja--start.html,"Friday, 28 January 2022",PTI,Business,"After a hiatus of nearly two decades, the Government's programme to privatise state-owned firms restarted with the handing over of debt-laden national carrier Air India to the Tata Group.
With the new owner shelling out Rs 18,000 crore for the buyout of the 'Maharaja', this would be the highest-ever amount garnered through privatisation, and is even more than the cumulative sum mopped up through strategic sales from 1999-00 to 2003-04.
The Government had in October last year inked the share purchase agreement with the Tata Group for sale of national carrier Air India for Rs 18,000 crore.
Tatas would pay Rs 2,700 crore cash and take over Rs 15,300 crore of the airline's debt. The deal also includes sale of Air India Express and ground handling arm AISATS.
The government had garnered roughly over Rs 5,000 crore during that five-year period by privatising 10 CPSEs. Besides, three hotel properties of Hotel Corporation of India and 18 of ITDC were also sold off by way of slump sale.
Here is a timeline of strategic sale of central public sector enterprises
(CPSEs) to private entities between 1999-00 to 2003-04: 1999-00 - Modern Food Industries Ltd -- Rs 105 crore2000-01 - BALCO , Lagan Jute Machinery Co Ltd -- Rs 554 crore 2001-02 - VSNL, Computer Maintenance Corporation (CMC), Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd (HTL), Paradeep Phosphate Ltd (PPL), some hotel properties of HCI and ITDC -- Rs 2,089 crore 2002-03 - Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL), Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL), some ITDC hotel properties -- Rs 2,335 crore 2003-04 - HZL (second tranche), Jessop & Co -- Rs 342 crore.

Govt should consider categorising EVs in priority lending sector: Omega Seiki Mobility,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/govt-should-consider-categorising-evs-in-priority-lending-sector--omega-seiki-mobility.html,"Wednesday, 26 January 2022",PTI,Business,"Electric vehicle maker Omega Seiki Mobility (OSM) has said the government should consider categorising EVs in the priority lending sector to further strengthen the segment, besides export concessions, to help the manufacturers tap new markets.
 In its pre-Budget expectations, OSM also expressed hope that the Union Budget includes announcements related to lowering of GST rates on raw materials, especially for the electric vehicle (EV)
players.
 This played a key role in the progress of electrification of the domestic automotive sector. However, the financial year 2022-23 is the time to start firing on all cylinders, Omega Seiki said.
 ""We are expecting Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to usher in good news for the EV sector.            ""To further strengthen the EV market, the government should consider categorising EVs in the priority lending sector. It will make EVs more affordable for the users and help in incentivising the whole transition,"" the company said.
 It said that the revised guidelines issued by the power ministry to accelerate the e-mobility transition in the country show that the Government recognises the importance of the EV sector's growth.
 The company added that the guidelines are already emphasising on enabling faster adoption of EVs, providing affordable tariffs and promoting energy security that finally aims at reducing the emission intensity in India.
 ""As part of India's growing EV industry, we hope that the Union Budget includes lowering of GST rates on raw materials, especially for the EV players.
 ""Support for R&D (research and development) and indigenous technology development while lowering of GST on auto components should be on the top of FM's agenda list,"" said Omega Seiki Mobility Chairman and founder Uday Narang.
 He further said allocating funds for the clean air campaign could be brought under the Swachh Bharat Mission to create better awareness and improve the adoption of electric mobility.             
 Export concessions can also be looked at to support the Indian EV manufacturers like OSM, it said, so that such companies can tap new markets, making India not just 'Aatmanirbhar' but a global powerhouse.

IMF cuts economy growth forecast to 9% in FY22,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/imf-cuts-economy-growth-forecast-to-9--in-fy22.html,"Wednesday, 26 January 2022",PTI,Business,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut India's economic growth forecast to 9 per cent for the current fiscal year ending March 31, joining a host of agencies which have downgraded their projections on concerns over the impact of a spread of new variant of coronavirus on business activity and mobility.
In its latest update of World Economic Outlook on Tuesday, the Washington-based international financial institution, which had in October last year projected a 9.5 per cent GDP growth for India, put the forecast for the next fiscal FY23 (April 2022 to March 2023) at 7.1 per cent.
The Indian economy had contracted by 7.3 per cent in the 2020-21 fiscal year.    The IMF's forecast for the current financial year is less than 9.2 per cent that the government's Central Statistics Office has predicted and 9.5 per cent that the Reserve Bank of India has estimated. Its forecast is lower than the 9.5 per cent projection by S&P and 9.3 per cent by Moody's but more than the 8.3 per cent projection by the World Bank and 8.4 per cent by Fitch.
According to the IMF, India's prospects for 2023 are marked up on expected improvements to credit growth and, subsequently, investment and consumption, building on better-than-anticipated performance of the financial sector.
The IMF said that global growth is expected to moderate from 5.9 in 2021 to 4.4 per cent in 2022, half a percentage point lower for 2022 than in the October WEO, largely reflecting forecast markdowns in the two largest economies -- the US and China. A revised assumption removing the Build Back Better fiscal policy package from the baseline, earlier withdrawal of monetary accommodation, and continued supply shortages produced a downward 1.2 percentage-point revision for the United States, it said.
In China, pandemic-induced disruptions related to the zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy and protracted financial stress among property developers have induced a 0.8 percentage-point downgrade.
The global growth is expected to slow to 3.8 per cent in 2023.     ""Although this is 0.2 percentage point higher than in the previous forecast, the upgrade largely reflects a mechanical pickup after current drags on growth dissipate in the second half of 2022. The forecast is conditional on adverse health outcomes declining to low levels in most countries by end-2022, assuming vaccination rates improve worldwide and therapies become more effective,"" said the report.
In a blog post, IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath wrote that the continuing global recovery faces multiple challenges as the pandemic enters its third year.          The rapid spread of the Omicron variant has led to renewed mobility restrictions in many countries and increased labour shortages, she said.
Supply disruptions still weigh on activity and are contributing to higher inflation, adding to pressures from strong demand and elevated food and energy prices, Gopinath wrote. "
RAI says there is need for Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme for biz establishments,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/rai-says-there-is-need-for-emergency-credit-line-guarantee-scheme-for-biz-establishments.html,"Wednesday, 26 January 2022",PTI,Business,"Retailer's body RAI on Tuesday said there is a need for the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for business establishments of the sector, which have been impacted by COVID-19-related restrictions.
 In its Budget wish list, the Retailers Association of India (RAI) also said more money needs to be put in the hands of the poor and the salaried as two years of the pandemic have impacted many in the poorer section of the population.            ""ECLGS for finance in retail needs to be announced as most of the lockdowns impact high contact sectors like restaurants, shops, salons, etc,"" RAI Chief Executive Officer Kumar Rajagopalan said in a statement.
 While the retail sector recently got included in priority lending guidelines under MSME, he said, ""It is important for the sector to get all support that MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) policies accord as more than 90 per cent of retail can be classified and MSME.""
 Calling for support to retail with policy around digitisation, Rajagopalan said retailers need to get themselves digitised faster and need to get e-commerce ready.
 ""Financial support for digitisation can help better boost the sector. Also, a directional focus to enable retailers through the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) will give a big boost to the sector,"" he added.
 Seeking a better direction for the implementation of goods and services tax (GST), RAI said any increase in GST on clothing, food and housing creates a direct impact on consumption.           ""A direction for a more predictable GST regime will be welcome. Similarly, many clauses around carry forward and refund of GST needs clarification,"" Rajagopalan said, adding that directional support to the creation of a nation-level policy for retail and internal trade will help.
 Asking for more money in the hands of the poor and the salaried, RAI said the two years of the coronavirus pandemic have impacted many in the poorer section of the population.              "
Benchmarks halt 5-day rout as bargain hunters move in; Maruti spurts,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/benchmarks-halt-5-day-rout-as-bargain-hunters-move-in--maruti-spurts.html,"Wednesday, 26 January 2022",PTI,Business,"Market benchmarks managed closed in the green on Tuesday after five sessions of steep losses as investors accumulated recently-battered banking, auto and FMCG counters amid a supportive trend in European equities.
 However, traders said the overall sentiment remains cautious ahead of a crucial two-day meeting of the US Federal Reserve where it will take a call on its rate hike trajectory. 
 Russia-Ukraine tensions, stubborn inflation and unabated selling by foreign funds are the other risk factors in the near-term, they added.            After plunging below the 57,000-level in opening trade, the 30-share BSE Sensex gained momentum as the session progressed to finish 366.64 points or 0.64 per cent higher at 57,858.15. 
 Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rose 128.85 points or 0.75 per cent to close at 17,277.95.
 Maruti topped the Sensex gainers' chart with a jump of 6.88 per cent after the country's largest carmaker posted a consolidated net profit at Rs 1,041.8 crore for the December quarter -- down 48 per cent y-o-y but well above analyst estimates.           Axis Bank, SBI, IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, PowerGrid and NTPC were among the other prominent gainers, spurting as much as 6.76 per cent.  In contrast, Wipro, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and UltraTech Cement led the laggards list, shedding up to 1.75 per cent.
 ""After a week-long consolidation, domestic indices took a breather supported by low-level buying. Western markets also supported, staging recovery following correction in oil markets, and as uncertainties over Fed policy and geopolitical tensions eased. 
 ""However, volatility is expected  to linger as investors await the Fed's final policy statement, providing clarity on the timeline of rate hikes,'' said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. 
 Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd, said, ""Markets will react to the Fed meeting outcome in early trade on Thursday and we expect volatility to remain high, thanks to the scheduled monthly expiry. Keeping in mind the scenario, we reiterate our cautious view and suggest preferring hedged positions.""
 Barring IT and consumer durables, all BSE sectoral indices mustered gains. Telecom climbed 2.46 per cent, followed by utilities, power, auto, bankex and realty.  In the broader markets, the BSE midcap and small cap indices advanced up to 1.03 per cent.

Confirm willingness to fund debt owned to lenders: FRL independent directors to Amazon,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/confirm-willingness-to-fund-debt-owned-to-lenders--frl-independent-directors-to-amazon.html,"Sunday, 23 January 2022",Agencies,Business,"Future Retail's independent directors have asked e-commerce giant Amazon if it is willing to fund Rs 3,500 crore to repay the retail company's lenders.
Notably, the question to Amazon was posted after the e-commerce giant in an earlier letter to independent directors objected to the sale of Future Retail Ltd (FRL)'s small-format stores.
""FRL is in need for cash infusion urgently in order to repay its lenders. FRL is required to pay its lenders `3,500 crore by January 29, failing which it will be classified as an NPA,"" said the letter dated January 21.
""Since you are objecting to the sale of small-format sales, the proceeds of which were to be used to repay lenders and thereby avoid NPA classification, please confirm that you are willing to fund this amount by Monday through an unsecured, long-term loan, subordinated to FRL's existing lenders or any other mutually suitable and legally acceptable structure.""
Besides, the letter to e-commerce giant said, ""If you do so, FRL will use such funds in order to repay FRL's existing lenders. Alternatively, you are also free to engage with the lenders so that we do not fall foul of our OTR process or obligations."" Accordingly, the independent directors asked the e-commerce giant to provide the confirmations for such funds by January 22, 2022.
""Once you have provided these confirmations in writing and agree to infuse ` 3,500 crore in order to repay FRL's lenders by January 29, 2022, we would be happy to assess a detailed proposal and meet Amazon India Head Abhijeet Muzumdar.""
Furthermore, the letter asked Amazon, ""Coming to the specific aspects of your proposal -- we note that your letter refers to a potential transaction between Samara Capital and FRL as a 'solution'.""
        ""In this regard, you are requested to confirm if Amazon can act on behalf of Samara Capital and has the authority to negotiate and finalise such transaction on its behalf.""
  It asked Amazon to confirm the structure for the proposed transaction, and that the Manager of Samara Capital is owned-and-controlled by resident Indians.
  ""As you know, FRL is in the multi-brand retail sector and FDI in this sector is restricted. You are also aware that Amazon's transaction in Future Coupons, has resulted in regulatory scrutiny, including by the Competition Commission of India, as well as enquiries by the Enforcement Directorate.""
  ""It is therefore critical that any investment being proposed is in compliance with all applicable laws, including FDI laws, CCI regulations and SEBI regulations, and that any such transaction should not raise further regulatory scrutiny.""

 ""Given by conservative estimate of each hotspot enabling 2-3 direct and indirect employment opportunities, the creation of 10 million hotspots as per the NDCP (National Digital Communications Policy) target by 2022 would potentially generate 20-30 million job opportunity in the small and medium scale sectors,"" Rajaraman said.

Industry Speaks: Make travel expenses deductible under IT returns in Budget FY23,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/industry-speaks--make-travel-expenses-deductible-under-it-returns-in-budget-fy23.html,"Sunday, 23 January 2022",Agencies,Business,"India's hotel and restaurant industry has urged the Centre to make travel expenses deductible under IT returns in Budget FY23.
Notably, the sector has been heavily battered due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent restrictions imposed to check the infections' spread.
According to Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, Vice President, Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India, since foreign travel is at least 12-15 months away from returning to the pre-pandemic levels, Centre should give impetus on domestic travel.
""We have requested Finance Minister to allow domestic travel for individuals and corporates to be a deductible expense in their IT returns. This tax incentive could be offered for a fixed number of years until hospitality comes back to pre-pandemic conditions,"" Kohli told IANS.
""The move will encourage the 28 million-plus people who otherwise travel out of the country, to holiday in India. We also ask for a review of the decision to introduce LTC cash vouchers in lieu of LTC fare to the Central Government employees.""
Besides, the hospitality industry has asked the Centre to be granted the infrastructure status.
  At present, only those hotels built with an investment of Rs 200 crore or more have been accorded infrastructure status.
  ""This threshold has to be brought down to Rs 10 crore per hotel to give a fillip to the budget segment hotels. This will enable hotels to avail of term loans at lower rates of interest and also have a longer repayment period,"" he said.
  ""We have also requested that hospitality should be accorded an industry status and set up a corpus fund to incentivise all states to align their policies and set off any losses that may occur due to its implementation. The lower cost of operations spread over a higher payback period will reduce the cost of our supply which will boost demand.""
  Among other measures, the industry has requested for working capital support with a guarantee from the Centre to banks and NBFCs.
  In addition, it has asked that the Rs 60,000 crore 'Loan Guarantee Scheme for Covid Affected Sectors' be notified with immediate effect.
  The Union Budget is slated to be tabled in the Parliament on February 1."
TAAI seeks ‘One India One Tourism' approach in Budget,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/taai-seeks----one-india-one-tourism--approach-in-budget.html,"Sunday, 23 January 2022",PTI,Business,"The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) has sought 'One India One Tourism' approach, which is inclusive of 'One Tax Structure,' in the forthcoming Union Budget to revive the pandemic-hit domestic travel, tourism and hospitality industry.
 Besides, the Association has sought bringing Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) under the ambit of GST to make air travel “more viable” for all stakeholders as well as extension of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS).
 There are several aspects which can be expected in the upcoming Budget to support the entire sector of 'travel tourism and hospitality,' which will help in making this sector  revive and survive, TAAI, which is headed by Jyoti Mayal, said in a statement on Saturday.
 “For this, it is extremely important for both the central and state governments to work in tandem to facilitate this sector and support it to be included in the concurrent list to get Industry status to make it more structured,” the Association said.
 TAAI said the Government should strive to increase the disposable income of the middle classes to spur that discretionary spending.            According to the travel agents body, concrete steps should be taken to improve cash flows and reduce the working capital burden on startups, existing MSMEs and SMEs along with access to easy credit, reducing income tax rate and GST rate, abolishment of tax collected at source (TCS) and wage support with ease of business.
 Besides, strengthening MSMEs, creating a fund of funds scheme for technology adoption for use in industry 4.0, reviving the Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme (CLCSS) for technology upgradation are the other steps TAAI is expecting in the forthcoming Union Budget, it said.           To revive this struggling sector, “we need 'One India One Tourism' approach inclusive of 'One Tax Structure,” TAAI said in the statement, adding that, important points to be considered are e-visa fees waiver for all tourist visas for 2022-2023, to support inbound revival export status for tourism export earnings.
 It has also sought double expenditure allocation for the tourism ministry to enable intensive global reach-out to support the inbound revival as well as domestic income tax travel credit for Indian citizens and Indian companies to support domestic retail and domestic MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions)pick-up.                The Association is also looking at a global bidding fund in the Union Budget 2022-23 to enable bidding support to Indian MICE companies to bring global MICE events to India, as per TAAI.   Lastly and most vital is a structured mechanism to secure travel agents' payments to ensure security for travel agents and operators' survival, it said.
 TAAI added that travel agents' payments to principals are unsecured credit and there is need to ensure that some form of mechanisms, whether escrow or guarantee or underwriting based mechanisms, are in place for securing travel agents money.               "

“High volatility due to rising bond yields is pressuring foreign investors to pull out funds from highly valued markets like India.
As the recent earnings failed to excite the market, the on-going global volatility drained investor confidence,” he added.

Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd, said the markets are currently facing global headwinds and there’s no relief from the domestic front as well. 
“However, we feel it’s a healthy correction so far and expect Nifty to hold the 17,600 zone. For traders, the major challenge is to tackle the volatility amid the earnings season. We feel it’s prudent to limit positions and prefer a hedged approach until markets resume the uptrend,” he noted. 
Sector-wise, BSE IT, teck, energy, healthcare and FMCG shed as much as 1.69 per cent, while power, utilities, metal and realty posted gains.

ICRA further said given that passenger vehicles (PV) category account for 20-25 per cent of overall traffic on toll projects, regional lockdowns imposed by state governments restricting people movement are expected to adversely impact the PV traffic as well as bus categories, as witnessed during the second wave of Covid-19.
The toll collections are, however, expected to be moderated by about 100 bps and will be supported by commercial vehicles as the manufacturing, construction activities and movement of goods are permitted, it added.
Giving more details, Vinay Kumar G, Sector Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said the FastAG collections peaked at `3,679 crore for December 2021, a growth of 12 per cent on a month-on-month basis as compared to November 2021.
He said restricted people movement owing to the third wave of pandemic is likely to affect the toll collections in the range of 7.5 per cent and 23.5 per cent on month-on-month basis in January and February 2022, respectively and recover thereafter.  "

In December 2021, imports of the precious metal rose to USD 4.8 billion from USD 4.5 billion in the year-ago period.
The surge in gold imports during the nine months contributed to the widening of the trade deficit to USD 142.44 billion against USD 61.38 billion in April-December 2020.
Similarly, silver imports also increased to USD 2 billion during April-December 2021 from USD 762 million in the same period of the previous fiscal.     India is the world's second-biggest gold consumer after China. The imports mainly take care of the demand by the jewellery industry.

"Budget could consider levying TDS/TCS on crypto trading, make it reportable in SFT",https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/budget-could-consider-levying-tds-tcs-on-crypto-trading--make-it-reportable-in-sft.html,"Monday, 17 January 2022",PTI,Business,"The Government could consider in the upcoming Budget levying TDS/TCS on sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies above a certain threshold and such transactions should be brought within the ambit of specified transaction for the purpose of reporting to income tax authorities, Nangia Andersen LLP Tax Leader Aravind Srivatsan said.
 Also, a higher tax rate of 30 per cent should be levied on the income arising from the sale of cryptocurrency, similar to winnings from lottery, game shows, puzzle, etc, he said.
 Speaking to PTI on what the Budget 2022-23, to be unveiled by the government on February 1, could have in store for the crypto industry in India, Srivatsan said currently, India has the highest number of crypto owners globally, at 10.07 crore and as per a report it is expected that the investment by Indians in cryptocurrency could touch USD 241 million by 2030.
 ""A bill was expected to be presented during Winter Session of Parliament to regulate cryptocurrencies. However, it was not introduced, and it is now expected that the government may take up this bill in the Budget Session. If the government does not prohibit Indians from dealing in cryptocurrencies, we expect that the government could introduce a regressive tax regime for cryptocurrencies,"" he noted.
 He said considering the size of the market, the amount involved, and the risk coupled with cryptocurrencies, certain changes may be brought in the taxation of cryptocurrencies like bringing them under the provisions of tax deducted at source (TDS) and tax collected at source (TCS) above a threshold limit which will help the Government get the ""footprints of the investors"".
 Both sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies should be brought under the ambit of reporting in the Statement of Financial Transactions(SFT).
 The trading companies already do similar reporting of sale and purchase of shares and units of mutual funds, he said.   To keep a watch on high value transactions undertaken by the taxpayer, the Income-tax law has the concept of SFT or reportable account.
   This helps tax authorities to collect information on certain prescribed high value transactions undertaken by any person during the year.                Financial institutions, companies and stock market intermediaries fall within the purview of SFT reporting. Srivatsan said similar to winnings from lottery, game shows, puzzle, etc., a higher tax rate of 30 per cent should be levied on the income arising from the sale of cryptocurrency. Ahead of the winter session of Parliament which ended of December 23, the government had listed for introduction a bill on regulating cryptocurrencies. The bill comes amid concerns over such currencies being allegedly used for luring investors with misleading claims.
 Currently, there is no regulation or any ban on use of cryptocurrencies in the country.
 The 'Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill' is now expected to be introduced in the Budget session of Parliament beginning January 31.  Separately, the government is mulling changes in income tax laws to bring cryptocurrencies under the tax net, and some changes that could form part of the 2022-23 Budget.        "

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) based retail inflation was 4.91 per cent in November 2021 and 4.59 per cent in December 2020.
The RBI, which mainly factors in the CPI-based retail inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy, has been tasked by the government to keep the inflation at 4 per cent with margin of 2 per cent on either side (that is, in the range of 2-6 per cent).
Retail inflation has been rising since October 2021. In July too the rate of price rise was 5.59 per cent but it slowed in the subsequent two months, before starting to move up from October.  
As per the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Wednesday, food inflation was at 4.05 per cent in December this fiscal compared to 1.87 per cent in the preceding month.
In the food basket, inflation was on higher side in 'cereals and products', eggs, 'milk and products', spices, and 'prepared meals, snacks and sweets' segments in December over the preceding month. However, the rate of price rise was slower in case of vegetables, fruits, and 'oil and fats'.          In the 'fuel and light' category, though the inflation softened from a month ago, it remained elevated at 10.95 per cent during the month. It was 13.35 per cent in November 2021.  
The Reserve Bank expects the inflation print to be somewhat higher over the rest of the year as base effects turn adverse.  According to the RBI, it is expected that headline inflation will peak in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal and soften thereafter. 
 Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra, said the increase in CPI inflation in December 2021 relative to the previous month was primarily led by food and beverages, and clothing and footwear. 
 There was a welcome moderation in the prints for fuel and light, and pan, tobacco etc amidst a mild dip in miscellaneous items and housing, she added.  ""Overall, we expect the headline CPI inflation to range between 5.7 - 6 per cent in Q4 FY2022, as compared to the MPC's (Monetary Policy Committee) forecast of 5.7 per cent.   ""While the CPI inflation has hardened sharply between November and December 2021, the uncertainty triggered by the third wave is sure to take precedence when the MPC meets next month. We now see a negligible likelihood of a change in stance or reverse repo hike in the February 2022 policy review,"" Nayar said.
 With a higher inflation target, the MPC can choose to prioritise growth revival for much longer than other major central banks, for many of whom inflation control has become a pressing policy focus, she noted.

Consumer durables’ prices to go up 5-10% as makers feel heat of rising input costs,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/consumer-durables----prices-to-go-up-5-10--as-makers-feel-heat-of-rising-input-costs.html,"Monday, 10 January 2022",PTI,Business,"Prices of air conditioners and refrigerators have shot up in the new year as consumer durables makers pass on the impact of rising raw material costs and higher freight charges to customers, while home appliances like washing machines may witness 5-10 per cent price hike later this month or by March.
 Companies including Panasonic, LG, Haier have already reviewed prices upwards, while other makers such as Sony, Hitachi, Godrej Appliances may take a call by the end of this quarter.
According to the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), the industry make hike prices from January to March in the range of 5-7 per cent.         “With an unprecedented surge in the cost of commodities, global freight and raw materials, we have taken steps to increase prices of our products by 3 to 5 per cent in the refrigerator, washing machines, and air conditioner categories,” Haier Appliances India President Satish N S told PTI. Panasonic, which has already increased prices up to 8 per cent for ACs, is considering hikes further. It is also mulling a similar move for home appliances.
 “Air Conditioners have already seen a price hike of around 8 per cent and this may further go up depending on rising costs of commodities and supply chain. We can also see a reflection of price hike for home appliances too in near future,” said Panasonic India Divisional Director, Consumer Electronics Fumiyasu Fujimori.
 South Korean consumer electronics major LG, which has also increased  prices in the home appliances category, said a constant hike in input raw material costs and logistics cost has been a concern.
 “We have tried best to absorb the same through cost innovations but prices need to increase for business sustainability,” said LG Electronics India Vice President, Home Appliances and Air Conditioner Business Deepak Bansal.
 Terming the price increase “inevitable”, Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India Chairman and Managing Director Gurmeet Singh said brands will hike prices up to 10 per cent in phases by April on account of an increase in input costs including that of raw materials, taxes, and transportation.
 “In a phased manner, up to April, prices will go up by at least 8-10 per cent. Prices have gone up from around the same time last year December to this year by nearly 6-7 per cent,” he said adding “the onslaught of Cost Up is continuing and now with anti dumping duties being imposed on aluminium and refrigerants, we see another increase by 2-3 per cent”.

"Taxmen to give ‘reasonable time' to biz to explain reasons for mismatch in GSTR-1, 3B before recovery action",https://www.dailypioneer.com/2022/business/taxmen-to-give----reasonable-time--to-biz-to-explain-reasons-for-mismatch--in-gstr-1--3b-before-recovery-action.html,"Monday, 10 January 2022",PTI,Business,"Tax officers will give reasonable time to erring business to explain reasons for mismatch in turnover reported in sales return GSTR-1 and tax payment form 3B before initiating recovery action for short payment or non-payment of taxes.
Apex indirect tax body CBIC has issued guidelines on recovery proceedings and said that taxmen would give a ""reasonable time"" to businesses to explain the reasons for such mismatch.
As per the changes in the GST law effective January 1, GST officers were allowed to directly initiate recovery action against those errant businesses which showed higher sales in monthly return GSTR-1 but under-report it while tax payment in GSTR-3B.             The move was aimed at curbing the menace of fake billing whereby sellers would show higher sales in GSTR-1 to enable a purchaser to claim an input tax credit (ITC) but report suppressed sales in GSTR-3B to lower GST liability.
So far, under the goods and services tax law, show-cause notices were first issued and then a recovery process was initiated in such cases of mismatch in GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B.
Following doubts raised by the trade and the field formations regarding modalities for initiation of the recovery proceedings, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on January 7 issued guidelines, saying that an opportunity needs to be provided to the concerned businesses for short payment or non-payment of the amount of self-assessed tax liability.
It noted that in some cases there may be a genuine reason for the difference between the details of outward supplies declared in GSTR-1 and those declared in GSTR-3B.          Giving example, the CBIC said the GST law permits rectification of typographical errors or omissions in the GSTR-1 or GSTR-3B of a particular month, in the returns or tax payment forms of subsequent months.      There may also be cases, where a supply could not be declared by the registered person in GSTR-I of an earlier tax period, though the tax on the same was paid by correctly reporting the said supply in GSTR-3B. The details of such supply may now be reported by the registered person in the GSTR-I of the current tax period.
""In such cases, there could be a mismatch between GSTR-l and GSTR-3B (liability reported in GSTR-I> tax paid in GSTR-3B) in the current tax period.             “Therefore, in all such cases, an opportunity needs to be provided to the concerned registered person to explain the differences between GSTR-I and GSTR-3B, if any, and for short payment or non-payment of the amount of self-assessed tax liability and interest thereon, before any action under Section 79 of the Act is taken for recovery of the said amount,” the CBIC said.
Wherever any such amount of tax, self-assessed by the registered person in his outward supply statement GSTR-I is found to be short paid or not paid through his GSTR-3B return, the tax officer would send a communication to pay the amount short paid or not paid or to explain the reasons for such short payment or non-payment of self-assessed tax, within a ""reasonable time"", as prescribed in the communication.              
""If the concerned person is able to justify the differences between GSTR-I and GSTR-3B, or is able to explain the reasons of such short-payment or non-payment of tax, to the satisfaction of the proper officer, or pays the amount such short paid or not paid, then there may not be any requirement to initiate proceedings for recovery under section 79,” the CBIC said."

This will not only help more than 1.75 lakh farmers to alleviate their incomes but will also create huge employment at various levels of the milk value chain. The joint venture will setup six dairy processing facilities across Assam, wherein milk from more than 4100 Dairy Cooperative Societies shall be processed, packed and marketed.
Rupala mentioned that the new initiative will lead to higher returns for the local dairy farmers, which is a step towards the aim of “Doubling Farmers’ Income” envisioned by the Prime Minister. He further said, as part of this dairy development project, more than 15000 high milk-yielding Gir cows will be inducted into Assam to ensure higher returns to the state’s dairy farmers. The plan also envisages setting up infrastructure for Cattle Feed and Silage manufacturing within Assam. He stressed on the need for breed improvement of cattle through technology."

Beijing’s Communist Party leaders further exploited the pandemic to impose their political agenda on many others, Joseph Wu said.
In particular, China’s vaccine diplomacy is creating divisions among countries in Central and South America, giving Beijing an opportunity to exert its influence in the Western Hemisphere, Wu said. Beijing is providing access to its domestically produced vaccines, other anti-coronavirus resources and development funding to those who are willing to accept political partnership with Beijing, he said.
China then uses this partnership to lure or pressure those allies of Taiwan and the US to lean toward Beijing. Through these maneuverings, China is trying to gain political influence in the region at the cost of Taiwan and the US.
China says its overseas assistance comes without political conditions, but has aggressively used its economic might in recent years to poach Taiwan’s few remaining allies and erode the influence of the US and other democracies.

Did not discuss politics: Kamal on meet with Rajini,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/02/22/did-not-discuss-politics-kamal-on-meet-with-rajini/,"February 22, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"Chennai: Actor-politician Kamal Haasan said there was a possibility of a third front being formed under his leadership for the coming assembly elections in Tamilnadu.
Speaking on the occasion of his party Makkal Needhi Maiam’s fourth foundation day celebrations at a private college here, Haasan also hinted he might consider an invite for alliance with the DMK if it came directly from the top leadership.
“I think it (a third front) may form. Situation is getting conducive. Very soon it may happen,” he said when asked whether there was a possibility of formation of a third front under his leadership in the state.
Asked about his meeting with superstar Rajinikanth, he said it was a casual meet between two friends.
“It was a normal discussion. We exchanged greetings as friends since I met him after undergoing a surgery, after a long time,” he said.
Asked whether he invited Rajinikanth to join MNM, he shot back saying, “he has (already) told that he will not take a political plunge citing his health. How can we invite then?. It will not be a good gesture from a good friend”.
The ruling AIADMK-BJP and DMK-Congress led alliances have already launched campaigns for the polls likely in April-May with their respective leaders undertaking tours.
MNM commenced issuing applications to aspirants for the party’s tickets for the polls, the first assembly elections in the state after the demise of AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa and DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi.
On alliance, he said MNM did receive an invite for forming an alliance with the DMK, indicating an emissary had approached the party.
“An invite did come, discussions took place.. everybody were discussing (on their own) but nobody came directly to me (for forming an alliance). But, that(talking directly) is what counts to me..Sending an emissary does not count. We can only accept a question or an answer which comes directly from a party high command,” he added.
On whether his party would form an alliance with Aam Aadmi Party, he said when Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal took part in the first year foundation day MNM in Madurai, he commenced his speech by seeking votes for the party
It just remained at a hand-shake level at that time…those who are concerned about people’s welfare are always welcome to join, he said.

The webinar titled ‘Can the youth shake up politics and policy in India’ allowed for academic discourse on a multitude of topics while majorly discussing the youth, policies and politics of India.
Issues of privatization, farm bills and the government’s way of expressing themselves at the grassroot level were brought to the table at the webinar organised by Kautilya School of Public Policy.
Actor Swara Bhaskar said, ‘the youth in India is not a homogenous but a large entity. It is ridden with class, caste, regional divides. We have seen the youth in this country already shape politics. In 2014, the big reason for the government coming to power was the number of votes they got from the youth. So, the youth is a shifting category. What unites the youth in this country today is technology and access to technology. The youth are constantly engaging and responding to policy and that cannot be ignored.”
Shazia Ilmi, spokesperson of the BJP, on the issue of criminalising protest and the impact it has on the youth stated that “It depends on who you’re talking to and the side you’re on. For the people who have just turned 18 or just entered politics, they need to Google and would find many cases of police atrocities and State repression done by previous regimes. I believe that as it did not stop me from joining politics, it should not for others.”

Dynasty politics is major cause of social corruption: Modi,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/01/13/dynasty-politics-is-major-cause-of-social-corruption-modi/,"January 13, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"Chennai: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called upon the youth of the country to contribute selflessly and constructively in politics.
Speaking at the valedictory function of the second National Youth Parliament Festival on Tuesday, the Prime Minister remarked that politics is a big medium to bring about meaningful change and like every other field, the presence of youth is critical in politics also.
Prime Minister assured the youth that today, honest people are getting the opportunity to serve, changing the old notion of politics as a site of unscrupulous activities. Today honesty and performance have become the need of the hour.
In this context, he dwelled at length on the politics of dynasty. He said corruption has become a burden on the people whose legacy was corruption. Country is preferring honesty over family connections and candidates are also understanding that only the good work matters.
He called upon the youth to root out the dynastic system. Dynasty politics gives rise to incapability and dictatorship in a democratic setup as these dynasts work towards saving the politics of their family and the family in politics.
“Today, days of winning elections by the crutches of a surname are over still this malaise of dynastic politics is far from over…Political dynasty promotes self and family instead of pushing nation first. This is a major cause of social corruption in India,” the Prime Minister said.
He exhorted the youth to come into politics as their entry will ensure the end of dynasty politics.
“It is imperative for saving our democracy that you join politics. You have a great guide in Swami Vivekananda and if, with his inspiration, our youth joins politics, country will be strengthened,” Modi said.

At the same time, I thank all those who did not take part in it following Rajini Makkal Mandram’s statement.”
“I have explained in detail why I chose not to enter politics already. In such a situation, holding such protests pains me a lot.” He urged them to desist from involving in such acts in future.
Rajinikanth on 29 December announced that he will not be starting his political party and that his recent health scare is a warning from God. Rajinikanth posted a tweet saying he doesn’t want to make the people who believe in him feel like a scapegoat, as his recent health conditions have come as a warning.
Rajinikanth further said, “I see this as a warning given to me by the Lord. If I campaigned only through the media and social media after I started the party, I would not be able to create the political upheaval among people and win big in the elections. No one with political experience will deny this reality.”
Rajinikanth said that he doesn’t want to start something and let it go halfway through and that his health doesn’t permit him to enter politics at this juncture and hence says he wants to refrain from starting the party. However, he added that he will continue to support the people of Tamilnadu.

Not only in the affairs of sports, I will also challenge him (Imran Khan) in field of politics. Imran should remember I was his captain, roared a visibly perturbed Miandad on his Youtube channel.
Annoyed with the mismanagement of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), former star cricketer Miandad lashed out at Imran Khan on several issues facing the nation.
Please do not bring people from abroad to manage our cricket. Look for deserving people in Pakistan. Believe in people of Pakistan, he said, indicating UK-returned PCB Chairman, Ehsan Mani, who has been residing in London for years.
Miandad was also not content with the work of Wasim Khan, a former Birmingham-based cricketer. Both Wasim and Ehsan Mani are said to be close to Imran Khan.
These people (Wasim and Ehsan) are outsiders. Suppose they are involved in some wrongdoing here and later run away from Pakistan, then who will be responsible for their act, Miandad asked.
The former Pakistan captain was also not happy with Imran Khan’s style of working. Tum Khuda ban kar baithe ho. Tumhe lagta hai ki tumhare alawa yahan kisi ko kuch pata nahi…. because you (Imran Khan) think that except you, no other person from Pakistan went to Cambridge or Oxford. Actually you don’t have any idea of what’s happening in Pakistan. You are relying only on such people (from abroad) whose intentions are bad. You don’t know what type of people (Wasim and Ehsan Mani) are, Miandad said, in an attack on the elite ring around the Pakistan Prime Minister.
Reminding Imran Khan of visiting his house in Karachi to muster support for last federal polls, Miandad said: He (Imran) came to my house on eve of polls. I backed him for Prime Ministership. I supported him. He should realise this fact. Imran cannot deny that I supported him. But he failed to fulfil his promise for the people of Pakistan.

“The BJP wishes to become the main opposition party of Tamilnadu (DMK is holding the position now). Duraisamy might have said in the context that there is a competition between the DMK and the BJP to occupy the second place,” he said.
He also said DMK president M K Stalin and his sister and Lok Sabha MP Kanimozhi don’t like each other.
Duraisamy said on Wednesday that his party will lead the fight against the DMK in 2021 Tamilnadu Assembly elections.
Effectively writing off the BJP’s own ally, the ruling AIADMK, he claimed that the six-decade Dravidian battle in Tamilnadu has turned into a BJP vs DMK contest. These comments triggered speculations in political circles and debates in news channels.
“Till last week, the 2021 elections were projected as DMK vs AIADMK, but after the departure of Ku Ka Selvam (DMK MLA from Thousand Lights constituency), it has become BJP vs DMK. This is a sign of our growth, we are growing fast in Tamilnadu. Like-minded parties would be part of the alliance, we will lead them because we are a national party,” he said.
However, later in the day, Tamilnadu BJP president L Murugan downplayed the remarks of Duraisamy and said Duraisamy had highlighted the growth of the BJP in Tamilnadu and that was all.

"Lockdown politics increasingly pit economic, health concerns",https://newstodaynet.com/2020/04/21/lockdown-politics-increasingly-pit-economic-health-concerns/,"April 21, 2020",Agency,Politics,"Washington: The global health crisis is taking a nasty political turn with tensions worsening between governments locked down to keep the coronavirus at bay and people yearning to restart stalled economies and forestall fears of a depression.
Protesters worrying about their livelihoods and bucking infringements on their freedom have taken to the streets in some places. A few countries are acting to ease restrictions, but most of the world remains unified in insisting it’s much too early to take more aggressive steps.
In the United States, there is clear evidence of the mounting pressure. The Trump administration says parts of the nation are ready to begin a gradual return to normalcy. Yet some state leaders say their response to the pandemic is hindered by a woefully inadequate federal response.
After insisting the country’s virus testing system was without fault, President Donald Trump announced Sunday evening that he would be using the Defense Production Act to compel increased manufacturing of testing swabs one of several products governors have been begging the president to help them acquire. White House officials will also be holding a call Monday with the nation’s governors to help walk them through where to find supplies, he said.
Trump also remained defensive, however, vowing that there were enough swabs to go around. Swabs are easy, the President said, bringing one to his news briefing and waving it in front of reporters.
That came hours after Washington state’s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, accused Trump of encouraging insubordination and illegal activity by goading protesters who flouted shelter-in-place rules his own administration has encouraged.
To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law, I can’t remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing, Inslee told ABC’s This Week.
He said it was dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives. Trump supporters in several states have ignored social distancing and stay-at-home orders, gathering to demand that governors lift controls on public activity.
The largest protest drew thousands to Lansing, Mich., on Wednesday, and others have featured hundreds in several states. The President has invoked their rallying cry, calling on some states with Democratic governors to LIBERATE, and he defended the demonstrations Sunday night, saying these people love our country. They want to go back to work. Inslee likened Trump’s response to schizophrenia.
Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, said it just doesn’t make any sense. We’re sending completely conflicting messages out to the Governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations, Hogan said on CNN’s State of the Union.

Rajinikanth discusses politics with RMM heads,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/03/05/rajinikanth-discusses-politics-with-rmm-heads/,"March 5, 2020",NT Bureau,Politics,"Rajinikanth with district heads of RMM in Chennai today.
Chennai: All roads led to Sri Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam at Kodambakkam in the city this morning where actor-politician Rajinikanth held crucial discussions with district secretaries of Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM).
Sources say that in the hour-long meeting, Rajinikanth spoke to them about the when to float his political party and ways and means to proceed further with their plans.
Amidst huge gathering of mediapersons and fans from various parts of the State, Rajinikanth clad in white pyjama and kurtha, arrived at the venue by 10 am.
He proceeded straight inside the Kalyana Mandapam. He reportedly listened to the works carried out by the RMM members in districts ever since he announced on 31 December, 2017 that he would float his own political party and face the Assembly elections.
The senior office-bearers of the RMM briefed him of the various works including appointing members of booth committees in their wards, welfare measures initiated to reach out to the people among others. Rajinikanth took suggestions on forming political party and how he should go about it from the district heads of RMM, sources said.
Buzz is that following suggestions from well-wishers and friends that with Assembly elections slated for anytime in 2021, Rajinikanthy discussed about starting his party by May or June. Following inputs that a minimum of six month time necessary to tour different districts and reach out to the masses, Rajinikanth reportedly discussed when to launch his party.
Unconfirmed reports say that the superstar urged RMM office-bearers to make sure that the members maintain decorum in social media and warned of strict action if they injdulge in any activities against the principles of the RMM.
Addressing mediapersons after the meeting, the district secretaries said, ”we discussed with Thalaivar about floating political party. We cannot divulge much details as only Thalaivar has to say about anything and everything regarding RMM”. ”There is an urgent need for a change of guard in Tamilnadu and no doubt, he will provide the same and reach out to the poor and needy across the State”, they added."
‘Kamal follows honest politics’,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/11/13/kamal-follows-honest-politics/,"November 13, 2019",NT Bureau,Politics,"Chennai: ”Kamal Haasan follows honest politics. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami doesn’t know it”, Makkal Needhi Maiam State secretary Murali Abbas has said.
Speaking to mediapersons yesterday, the Chief Minister lashed out at actor-filmmaker and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal. ”What does he know about politics. Kamal is still acting so that at least his party cadres will see his movies. He has started a party as a precaution as he is not getting enough chances in cinema. Actors float their own political parties after getting old. They will all face the same fate that of actor Sivaji Ganesan who started a party,” he said.
Though Kamal Haasan has not given his reply, Murali Abbas said, ”Kamal is doing honest politics”.
Senior leader of the party, Mahendran, said, ”Politics is a means to do good for people. Every honest individual has the right and responsibility to do his best for the welfare of everyone. Kamal Haasan has ventured to politics to render selfless service to people”."
Will Modi-Xi meet bring changes in TN politics?,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/10/10/will-modi-xi-meet-bring-changes-in-tn-politics/,"October 10, 2019",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"Chennai: Though the informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jingping, set to take place in nearby Mamallapuram this weekend, has officially got nothing to do with local politics, there are speculations that it would pave way for changes in Tamilnadu political arena.
The ‘GoBackModi’ hashtags, which greeted the Prime Minister whenever he visited TN in the recent years, are unlikely to appear on social media this time, as DMK president M K Stalin, the most vocal opponent of the BJP government, has welcomed the summit and even hailed the PM and the Chinese President for choosing Mamallapuram as the venue.
”I feel happy that the Chinese premier is going to come to Tamilnadu. I welcome his visit wholeheartedly. I feel proud that PM Modi and Chinese President will have joint talks in Mahabalipuram, which is a historical place,” he said in a statement.
He thanked the Central government for choosing the location and said that the Pallava kings, who ruled the southern India centuries ago, had close relations with China through sea trade.
MDMK leader Vaiko, an alliance partner of the DMK and popular for showing black flags to Modi, has said the second informal summit of the PM and Chinese President in the ancient town of Pallavas, Mamallapuram, is historic.
”I hope the summit of the two leaders in Mamallapuram will lead to blooming of brotherhood between the countries and create peace in the Asian continent,” he said and placed a string of requests to the Centre including an infrastructure upgrade to Mamallapuram.
Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, who is personally supervising arrangements being made for the high profile event, has said that the second informal summit between the Prime Minister and Chinese President in the State on 11 and 12 October was a matter of ‘pride’ and has raised its stature in the global arena.
”I welcome both these world leaders on behalf of the people of Tamilnadu and the state government,” he said in an official statement.
If sources are to be believed, Palaniswami, Stalin and actor Rajinikanth are among top personalities who have been invited for the dinner Modi will be hosting to Jingping in Mamallapuram. The PM, who is lately expressing his love for Tamil in international arena, is expected to display it once again during the summit.
Given the above developments and the BJP high command’s burning desire to make the party gain inroads in Tamilnadu, political observers are of the opinion that the upcoming event would change a few political equations here. But, sources in the national party say everything should not be viewed as politics."

Chennai: Students should not stay away from politics. Without discussing politics, there cannot be any development in education and politics, said Makkal Needhi Maiam president Kamal Haasan.
Speaking at the Media Con 19 conducted by Loyola College here, the actor-turned-politician, said, “Youngsters should not look up to politicians to fulfil all needs. Because of them everything is stained.”
Interacting with students, he touched upon recent protests and remarks against alleged Hindi imposition by the Centre. Kamal Haasan, said, “Language is a tool for communication. We should decide what we should eat in a restaurant and hotel management has no right to impose anything on us.”
He also clarified that he is not against any language. Meanwhile in a press release, it was announced that Kamal will take part in a Grama Sabha meeting tomorrow at 10 am in Pazhaverkadu, being organised as part of 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi."
Historic day in world politics: BJP on Howdy Modi,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/09/23/historic-day-in-world-politics-bjp-on-howdy-modi/,"September 23, 2019",PTI,Politics,"New Delhi, Sept: Hailing the ”Howdy Modi” event in Houston as “unprecedented” and “history in the making”, top BJP leaders today said it has left an indelible footprint of a stronger India on the world map.
“A historic day in world politics! Leaders of the two most powerful democracies shared their ideas & dreams for a prosperous world together in a way that one has never seen before. #HowdyModi was unprecedented. It has left an indelible footprint of a stronger India on world map,” BJP president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted.
In a reference to Modi’s attack on Pakistan over the issue of terrorism, he said the message to the world is loud and clear that this “new India” will leave no stone unturned to keep the country safe and united.
Thanks to Modi’s leadership, the entire world today stands firmly with India in its decisive fight against the menace of terrorism, Shah said, asserting that the prime minister’s popularity has soared across the globe.
It is a recognition of the people of India. The grand event is testimony of India’s power under Modi, he said.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the event in Houston has reignited shared Indian-American dreams and their bright futures.
“The oldest and largest democracies joined hands today giving us hope and a promising future. It was history in the making,” he said.
With the Congress accusing Modi of “violating” the Indian foreign policy’s time honoured principle of not interfering in the domestic elections of another country by “campaigning” for US President Donald Trump at the Houston event, BJP’s Amit Malviya took a dig at the opposition while calling its charge preposterous.
“I can understand some in the Congress are peeved at the massive success of Howdy Modi but to allege that the PM interfered in US elections is preposterous.”
“He referred to the ‘Aabki Baar Trump Sarkar’ slogan and its resonance with the Indian-American community back in 2016! Listen,” the BJP’s IT department head said while posting a clipping of the Prime Minister’s speech."
Cricketer Monty Panesar eyes world of politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/09/14/cricketer-monty-panesar-eyes-world-of-politics/,"September 14, 2019",PTI,Politics,"London: Former England off-spinner Monty Panesar, who recently turned author with his book ‘The Full Monty’, has spoken of plans to take on the world of politics, possibly as a future Mayor of London.
The 37-year-old spinner, who had handed over copies of his book to the Indian cricket team during their UK tour for the Cricket World Cup in June-July, said he would next like to tackle politics at the end of his cricketing career.
“Politics does interest me. I live in London, I know about London so maybe once Sadiq Khan is done, he will pass the baton on to me for Mayor of London,” Panesar told a gathering organised by the Indian Journalists’ Association (IJA) in London on Friday.
Asked if he had chosen the political affiliation for his future career, he said: “I haven’t really decided that yet because I am still ambitious to play cricket. I will be working on being super fit for the county season but in the meantime, when you are not playing cricket or training, you have to occupy your mind. And, one of my activities is reading about politics.”
Describing India as the superpower of cricket, Panesar said that it is the Indian fans that make championships successful by their numbers and enthusiasm.
“India is now a thriving nation and soon India will take over the world,” said the bowler, who triggered ‘Monty Mania’ with his very first wicket for the England team being that of Sachin Tendulkar in 2012.
He fondly refers to the Indian batting legend as ‘Sachin Paaji’. “Sachin Tendulkar should always be at the top. He was a role model not just for India but also for British Indians. He is the greatest sportsman ever and will always be the god of cricket,” he said.
In his book, Panesar speaks about the racism faced by his parents’ generation, about growing up as a happy, cricket-obsessed child in England and his thoughts about the infamous Lord Norman Tebbit cricket test, which questioned the loyalties of Britain’s immigrant population."

Editorial: Playing politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/08/27/editorial-playing-politics/,"August 27, 2019",NT Bureau,Politics,"Chennai: Tension might have come down in Jammu and Kashmir after the Centre’s move to scrap special status. But the war of words over the issue has not.
Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Monday accused Rahul Gandhi of playing politics over his invitation to visit the Valley, saying he just wanted to refrain him from making ‘baseless statements’.
“I want to make it clear that when I had invited Rahul Gandhi to Jammu and Kashmir, my intention was that he will refrain from making baseless statements about Kashmir by having the first-hand appraisal of the situation,” the Governor said in a statement.
He added that the Congress leader had turned it into ‘non-ending issue’. Accusing Rahul Gandhi of playing politics over the issue, Malik said he arrived there along with a host of opposition leaders and said he would meet all detained leaders and interact with mediapersons. “When Rahul Gandhi played such kind of politics with my invitation, I withdrew my invitation. And it was now a prerogative of the administration to decide whether Rahul Gandhi should visit Kashmir or not,” he said. Malik said the administration had made it clear beforehand that at a time when they were making efforts to maintain peace in the Valley, no politician should come to ‘make a breach’, rather ‘help in maintaining peace’.
He said Rahul Gandhi should understand that the visit would have created problems for people. “Rahul Gandhi tried to create obstacles in the peace process. When he was not allowed to do so, Rahul on his return to New Delhi made false statements about the situation in Kashmir,” Malik said.
“I want to tell Rahul Gandhi that such statements made by him are being used by Pakistan against India. He should understand that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is fragile and it is the issue of national interest. His statements harm the national interest,” he added.
Malik said he wanted to urge Gandhi that he should keep national interest on top, rather than using the sensitive issue for his ‘cheap politics’. This is time for unity and all political parties should stay united in protecting the country’s interest. There should not be place for politics."

Deepa started her party in 2017 after the death of Jayalalithaa. She unsuccessfully tried to contest the RK Nagar bypoll. However, her nomination was rejected.
Speaking to a television channel, Deepa said she had a bad experience in politics. “The main reason is, after the formation of the Peravai, it was taken on a different direction and I was cheated. I was not prepared for all this, had no experience, no guidance in politics. I didn’t have the right people to guide me,” she said.
She claimed that she was personally attacked many times during her stint in politics and that there was lot of pressure. She said she didn’t expect that her time in politics would be a bad experience.
She further asked people to stop posting abusive comments on women who wanted to pursue politics. She said her supporters were free to join any party they wanted to and that she personally preferred AIADMK."
"Dhoni may enter politics, be part of Team Modi, says BJP leader",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/07/13/dhoni-may-enter-politics-be-part-of-team-modi-says-bjp-leader/,"July 13, 2019",Agency,Politics,"New Delhi: Former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has brought numerous laurels for the country, may enter politics after retiring from cricket, a senior BJP leader has said.
Speaking to news agency IANS on Friday, former Union Minister and BJP leader Sanjay Paswan has said that MS Dhoni might begin his new innings in politics as part of ‘Team Narendra Modi’.
Paswan said that Dhoni can join the saffron party and there has been a discussion on the issue for long.
“On this issue, there has been a discussion for long, although this decision will be taken only after his retirement,” he added. On his equation with the world-renowned wicket-keeper batsman, Paswan said that he has known him for long and remains hopeful that he will join the saffron party after retiring from cricket.
“Dhoni is my friend, he is a player of world fame and there have been discussions on bringing him into the party fold,” the BJP leader said. The remarks from the senior BJP leader comes at a time when Dhoni is in the centre of a public debate on Skipper Virat Kohli’s decision to send him to bat at no. 7 during the ICC men’s World Cup semi-final clash against New Zealand, which India lost.
After India crashed out of the ICC World Cup tournament, speculations are rife about MS Dhoni’s likely retirement from cricket, with many suggesting the iconic cricketer to continue playing for the country.
Several acclaimed international cricketers, including former Australia captain Steve Waugh and former Pakistani pacer Shoiab Akhtar, have backed Dhoni’s approach in the semi-final match against New Zealand.
They even went on say that ‘without Dhoni, there would not be a chance to win a game.’ “I think it is pretty unfair. MS Dhoni has won so many games to India and he has played in the same way over the long period of time. He can get you in a situation that can give you a chance to win the game and without him, there would not be a chance to win a game,” Waugh said.
It may also be recalled that Dhoni was one of the celebrities whom BJP chief Amit Shah visited during his ‘Sampark for Samarthan’ campaign ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
The elections in Dhoni’s home State Jharkhand are scheduled to take place later this year. It is believed that MSD may even be the Chief Ministerial face of the BJP in the coming Jharkhand polls."
‘Bigg Boss’ has got nothing to do with Kamal’s politics: Endemol CEO,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/07/03/bigg-boss-has-got-nothing-to-do-with-kamals-politics-endemol-ceo/,"July 3, 2019",Balasubramani Muniyandi,Politics,"Abhishek Rege
Chennai: ‘Bigg Boss 3‘ which began more than a week ago, has already garnered attention of viewers with people rooting for their favourite contestant.
In a telephonic conversation with News Today, the show’s producer Endemol Shine India’s CEO Abhishek Rege talks about the programme, actor-politician Kamal Haasan as the host and the future plans of the company. Abishek said he is happy about the viewership increase from BB1 to BB3.
“The anticipation was very high even before the launch of the season. People want to see what is going to happen inside the house. We have a hard task of fulfilling their expectations,” he said. Viewers have started to look for the content and I feel this is a good sign, he said.
When asked about how much Kamal’s political entry has influenced the viewership of the show, Abishek said Kamal pulled in a lot of eyeballs even for season one, which was aired before his political entry.
“The show has got nothing to do with his political stand. People watch it for the entertainment portions. Moreover, Kamal knows where to draw a line,” he said.
Further talking about what he thinks to be the reason behind the success of Bigg Boss, Abishek said the realistic and unscripted nature is what makes the people to anticipate for the show everyday.
“Seeing something happen in your own language creates a huge impact. The tasks are also designed in such a way that it makes the contestants interact,” he said.
Abhishek further said some tasks are psychological, while some physical. “These tasks help people to take decision on time and that unpredictiveness is what interests the audience,” he said.
Elaborating on the process involved in selecting the candidates, he said we want people who make the ‘house’ lively. “There is not point in bringing in big names who do not interact or do something that interests the audience. With the passing of every season, the contestants who come into the show will have an idea of what will happen inside the house. We will have to overthink them which is another challenge. The main attraction is to find out contestants that are appealing to the audience, but the baseline is how evolved they actors get. Though the show is not a scripted one, at the end of the day it is more like a serial. Every regional show has certain traditional and cultural values and we try to reflect them in the show as well. But it is not a hard and fast rule,” he said.
Speaking about the controversies surrounding BB, Abhishek said the company is okay with it.
“We do not plan any controversies. It is all the contestants reacting to a situation in the heat of the moment. These reactions are much like how they happen in the outside world. Just because you see it on screen does not mean, we push it professionally. If something happens in the house, it is sorted out in the best manner. Audience realise this and that is why they are following it,” he added.
Endemol is also all set to venture into producing films and their first project in Tamil will be directed by Pandiraj. “We were in talks with a bunch of directors, Pandiraj was one among them. He is an extremely talented filmmaker and we are eager to work with him especially after Kadaikutty Singam. The shoot will commence from the end of this year. We are in talks with the cast which will be finalised by the end of July or early August. It will be a family entertainer,” he said.
Apart from producing movies, Endemol will also be venturing into scripted shows in the future.
“We have not been known for scripted serials. However, we have produced a few in Marathi, Hindi and Bangla. By the end of 2019, we will have a couple of reality game shows and scripted shows. This will be our key focus,” he said.
Abhishek said the company has acquired the rights of Amitav Ghosh’s IBIS trilogy: Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke and Flood of Fire. The web series adaptation of the book will be co-produced by Endemol India along with its UK label in association with director Shekhar Kapur and Pirates of the Caribbean writer Justin Pollard."

"Review: ‘NGK’ – Politics, pressure & pain",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/31/review-ngk-politics-pressure-pain/,"May 31, 2019",M BHARAT KUMAR,Politics,"A political satire by Selvaraghavan. It sounds nice to hear. The man who captured human emotions raw and real on screen is out with a mass film this time. In the process, Selvaraghavan tries to balance both and eventually ends up neither here nor there. But thanks to Suriya’s superb show and mighty screen presence, it manages to be a watchable fare.
More of the recent political film LKG meeting Selva’s cult classic Pudhupettai, NGK in a nutshell is about a young man, who wants to do good for people. He is compelled to enter politics to serve the purpose and the hurdles that he face to achieve his goal is what it is.
The director sprinkles mother-son and husband-wife sentiments at a few places. It eventually harps on the need for educated youngsters to enter politics.
Set in Srivilliputhur, the movie revolves around Nandha Gopalan Kumaran aka NGK (Suriya), a M Tech graduate, who takes up organic farming in his village. He along with his friends involve in social service acts winning the admirations of locals. His wife Mythili (Sai Pallavi) stands by him in all his endeavours. Things take a turn when NGK is made to realise that his ambitions to serve the society and live for the cause of motherland can be realised only if he enters politics. He befriends local MLA (Illavarasu). He soon rises in ranks thanks to Amaithipadai Amavasaique acts. He happens to even meet the leader of the party (Ponvannan). Here comes NGK’s acquaintance with Vanathi (Rakul). She is a professional PR hired by the party to help them face elections. She holds enormopus clout within the party. She involves NGK in her plans to help party get a good image among public as election nears. Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of Tamilnadu (Devaraj) plans to bump off NGK fearing his rising popularity. A series of events happens as NGK uses things to his advantage. Eventually he gets what he wants but with many sacrifices.
Suriya shoulders all the burden. He is bubbly and energetic. His character seems to be an extension of the one he had played in Taana Serndha Kootam. Anger, agony, excitement, joy, revenge and romance. Sai Pallavi as Suriya’s wife gets adequate opportunities. Sadly for those expecting a ‘Rowdy Baby…,’ she doesn’t shake her leg. Rakul Preet is more sedate. And the rest including Ponvannan, Devaraj or Illavarasu speak from their belly.
A major highlight of the movie is Yuvan Shankar Raja’s background score. It adds value to the proceedings at many places.
Sadly, the movie struggles especially towards the second half as Selvarahgavan cannot find a balance between mass and raw emotions. A lot has been said about social media and its influence in electoral politics, which we had seen umpteen times recently on big screen. It eventually ends up as neither Selvaraghavan nor Suriya film. A sense of deja vu prevails as the story is beaten-to-bush in Tamil cinema in the recent past."

Chennai: Monday saw three important political happenings in Tamilnadu. With counting of votes polled in Lok Sabha elections and in by-polls to 22 Assembly constituencies in the State around the corner (23 May), these quick unfolding of events left many raise their eye-brows in surprise.
Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekara Rao yesterday called on DMK president M K Stalin at the latter’s residence in the city. His visit was seen as an effort to stitch together an alliance at the national-level to form a non-Congress and non-BJP front and seek DMK’s support.
Many in the Congress say that Stalin was the first to project Congress president Rahul Gandhi as the next Prime Minister and their bonding is strong. But a section are miffed at DMK leaders accepting to meet KCR knowing well his agenda. And they also want DMK to tell in open what was discussed at the meeting.
Meanwhile, there was little confusion in AIADMK-BJP camp too. State Minister D Jayakumar had remarked that Stalin had met KCR to strike a deal with BJP to get Ministerial berths at the Centre.
Reacting to his allegations, a BJP office-bearer, said, “Such comments are needless and uncalled for. We are in an alliance with AIADMK. Such remarks by Jayakumar would put us in trouble among the eyes of public.”
Interestingly, TNCC chief KS Alagiri extending support to Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan has surprised DMK men. Apparently referring to Godse, Kamal, while addressing a campaign event, said that India’s first terrorist was a Hindu.
Alagiri said, “I support and agree Kamal Haasan’s statement, not only 100 per cent but 1,000 per cent.” DMK which considers Kamal as someone who would play spoilsport on its share at the ballot, is miffed at Congress support to MNM chief.
Political observers say it is just the beginning of many things to come as just nine days are away for counting of votes. “Nothing is permanent in politics – even friends and enemies,” they add."
"Kamal indulging in divisive politics, says BJP",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/14/kamal-indulging-in-divisive-politics-accuses-bjp/,"May 14, 2019",NT Bureau,Politics,"Aravakurichi/New Delhi: A day after actor-politician Kamal Haasan stoked controversy over his ‘independent India’s first extremist was a Hindu’ remark, the BJP lashed out at him saying he was indulging in divisive politics and was showing Hindus in a bad light to appease minorities just like the Congress and Communists.
While addressing a election campaign in Aravakurichi – one of the four Assembly constituencies where bypolls are scheduled on 19 May – the Makkal Needhi Maiam chief said, “I am not saying this because this is a Muslim dominated area, but I am saying this before a statue of Gandhi. Independent India’s first extremist was a Hindu, his name is Nathuram Godse. There it starts.” He further stated that he was Gandhi’s self-assumed great-grandson and had come there to seek answers for Mahatma’s murder.
His remarks drew ire from the BJP State unit president Tamilisai Soundararajan. “The Election Commission should take tough action against Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) chief Kamal Haasan for his remarks on ‘Hindu Terror’ at a campaign event,” she said. “Though he talks of taking forward a new kind of politics, he also indulged in the old, mischievous, poisonous and divisive vote bank politics” and his remarks amounted to inciting communal violence, she added.
Union Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “It proves that he does not understand the difference between an assassin and a terrorist. An assassin is very different from a terrorist. Therefore if only he goes through the entire history and also follows up on the trial of Mahatma Gandhi he would know the difference … He is in a hurry to prove that he follows the same line of appeasing minorities for the sake of his newly launched venture.”
K T Rajenthra Bhalaji, Tamilnadu Minister and a senior AIADMK leader, said Kamal acted to garner votes and that his tongue should be cut of for making such a remark. He noted that Extremism had no religion and also sought a ban on Kamal’s party MNM for sowing violence.
However, leaders from Congress and Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) came in support of Haasan. TNCC President K S Alagiri said he agreed with Kamal 1000 percent. DK chief K Veeramani said Godse trained with RSS. “Not just that, even Pragya Singh Thakur is only out on bail, he added. Pragya was BJPs Lok Sabha candidate in Bhopal and an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case.
Actor Vivek Oberoi condemned Haasans remarks. “Dear Kamal sir, you are a great artist. Just like art has no religion, terror has no religion either! You can say Godse was a terrorist, why would you specify Hindu? Is it because you were in a Muslim dominated area looking for votes? Please sir, from a much smaller artist to a great one, lets not divide this country, we are one Jai Hind..#AkhandBharat #UnDividedIndia,” he tweeted.
In November 2017, Kamal had triggered a controversy when he took potshots at what he termed as Hindu extremism, drawing condemnation from the BJP and Hindu outfits."
2019 elections: What will happen in Tamilnadu politics after 23 May?,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/04/30/2019-elections-what-will-happen-in-tamilnadu-politics-after-23-may/,"April 30, 2019",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"Chennai: Cliched it may sound, but all eyes are on 23 May, the day that will decide the future of politics and politicians in India in general and Tamilnadu in particular. Reason: along with the results of Lok Sabha elections, those of by-polls in 22 Assembly constituencies in the State will also be announced that day.
The continuance of the AIADMK government, led by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, which is already surviving on a wafer-thin majority, will be decided 23 May. In the 234-member House, Palaniswami needs the support of at least 118 MLAs for a simple majority.
The recent step by the ruling party to disqualify three legislators for allegedly showing loyalty to AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran is seen by the Opposition as a move to bring down the total strength of the Assembly and win the trust vote, in case a no-confidence motion is brought in the Assembly after the results.
Says Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, who is the coordinator of the AIADMK, “We will never indulge in cheap tactics. Why should we worry when we are going to win all the 22 seats? People are with us, Amma’s (former CM and AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa) blessings are with us.”
For the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, victory in eight of the 22 constituencies is said to be enough for it to continue its rule.
The principal Opposition, the DMK, and its allies have a total of 97 MLAs, one down from the actual strength of 98 due to the demise of party chief M Karunanidhi last year. The party has to win a minimum of 21 seats in the by-polls to come to power and get a simple majority.
Says DMK treasurer Durai Murugan, “Wait till 23 May and watch what is going to happen in Tamilnadu. I had learnt politics from Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) and will ensure that this government falls as soon as the results are out. Stalin will become the Chief Minister by the end of this month and he will rule Tamilnadu for decades.”
According to Thangavel, a political observer, “I am keeping my fingers crossed. Tamilnadu is witnessing such a peculiar scenario for the first time, that, too, in the absence of tall leaders like Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa. It is going to be a do-or-die situation for both the AIADMK and DMK.”"

Focus of TN politics shifts to by-poll in 4 Assembly constituencies,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/04/23/focus-of-tn-politics-shifts-to-by-poll-in-4-assembly-constituencies/,"April 23, 2019",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"Chennai: So, the battle continues after a brief break. Only a week ago, political leaders in the State completed their literally heated campaign for elections to 38 Lok Sabha and 18 Assembly constituencies.
They are now gearing up to start their canvassing again, with by-polls in four Assembly segments –  Thirupparankundram, Sulur, Aravakurichi and Ottapidaram – slated to be held 19 May.
The main Opposition DMK and fledgling AMMK have already named their candidates for the four seats, while the ruling AIADMK and Kamal Haasan’s MNM are likely to do it anytime.
Since it is expected that the scrutiny will be more this time, thanks to wide-ranging allegations of money flow in Tamilnadu and with the Election Commission now having the task of managing just four constituencies, parties are devising fresh strategies to woo voters.
“We have new techniques to attract people and make them vote for us. But, we can’t reveal them right now. We even know what our rivals are going to do,” says a member of a political party.
An office-bearer of its opponent organisation says, “They have not learnt their lessons even after the recent crackdown against them. Our sleeper-cells in their outfit will inform their activities to us and we will in turn alert the officials.”
A functionary of another party says, “We are not going to indulge in money distribution. We are pretty sure about winning the by-polls since people’s support is with us. We will adopt other strategies to attract voters.”
From next week, a high-voltage campaign is expected to take place in these four places, with Chief Minister and AIADMK joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami, Deputy CM and the party’s coordinator O Panneerselvam, DMK president M K Stalin, AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran and MNM founder Kamal Haasan getting ready to meet the people and seek votes.
Tamilnadu Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo says, “We will maintain strict vigil in the four constituencies and flying squads will be at work. Vulnerable and critical polling booths will be listed out and additional security will be provided. All steps will be taken to ensure free and fair elections.”"
Civility a rare virtue in Indian politics: Tharoor,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/04/16/civility-a-rare-virtue-in-indian-politics-tharoor/,"April 16, 2019",Agency,Politics,"Thiruvananthapuram: Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today called on Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who is in hospital after suffering head injuries while performing a ritual at a temple here.
Tharoor, the Thiruvananthapuram MP and party candidate in the 23 April Lok Sabha polls, was injured when the hook of a weighing scale came off and its iron panel hit his head during the ‘Thulabharam’ ritual.
He was admitted to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical college hospital Monday, and is expected to be discharged later today.
The former Union Minister later tweeted, “Touched by the gesture of @nsitharaman, who dropped by today morning to visit me in the hospital, amid her hectic electioneering in Kerala.Civility is a rare virtue in Indian politics – great to see her practice it by example!.”
‘Thulabharam’ is a Hindu ritual in which a person is weighed against a commodity such as flowers, grains, fruits and similar articles in temples and the equal value or quantity is offered as donation.
Monday being the Malayalam new year day (‘Vishu’), Tharoor performed the ritual by offering sugar equal to his weight in the morning before embarking on his poll campaign.
Nirmala Sitharaman had reached Kerala Monday night and held a road show at Thiruvananthapuram along with BJP candidate Kummanam Rajashekaran C Divakaran, the CPI and left front candidate, who is opposing Tharoor, also visited him at the hospital.
“Very gracious of my LDF rival C Divakaran to call this morning to express concern about my well-being.Said he had spoken to the Hospital Superintendent to assure himself I would be ok,” Tharoor said."

Chennai South MNM candidate Rangarajan gives up IAS to enter politics (video),https://newstodaynet.com/2019/04/06/chennai-south-mnm-candidate-rangarajan-gives-up-ias-to-enter-politics-video/,"April 6, 2019",R Rangaraj,Politics,"Chennai: It is not often that one gives up a prestigious career in the Indian Administrative Service. R Rangarajan, who emerged 45th in the all India civil services exam, joined the IAS and served in Assam for a few years but gave it all up in a mission to serve the people.
Inspired by actor Kamal Haasan’s new party, Makkal Needhi Maiam, he is now the party’s candidate for the Chennai South Lok Sabha constituency.
Rangarajan talked to News Today TV / Maalaisudar TV  in an exclusive interview on his aspirations and how he would contribute to solve the many problems that Chennai South faces:
Asked about the basic problems in Chennai’s outlying areas regarding drainage, stormwater drains, water supply, etc., Rangarajan says Chennai has gone from bad to worse in the last few years. While several suburban areas were added to Greater Chennai region in the hope that their basic problems would be resolved, Rangarajan says there has been no serious attempt to address these issues.
“Water scarcity is severe. The need for drinking water is so acute that desperate people tell me during my campaign along an entire stretch of 7 to 8 km that they would vote for me en bloc if I can provide them water,” he says.
Underground drainage continued to be denied to a large number of people in this constituency. The situation is such that an ecological disaster is inevitable with sewage from sumps contaminating ground water.
Open drains also contribute to spread of diseases. How does Rangarajan hope to deal with this situation?
“Yes, it is true that this is a situation for an ecological disaster. People in my party, especially Kamal Sir, and I have been in discussions with various experts to find a holistic solution to the issues relating to infrastructure. I have discussed with Janakarajan (of MIDS) and others relating to solutions to the city’s infrastructure needs, and we can provide a holistic plan of action,” promises Rangarajan.
Chennai region suffered enormously during the floods and heavy rains in the last few years. Lakhs of people lost their belongings and life savings. They are still struggling to return to their old standard of living. The scars still remain. How does Rangarajan propose to ensure that the city will not suffer due to flooding again?
“This is a serious and emotional issue for a large number of people. They lost not just electronic appliances but also cars and houses. It will take a long time for them to recover from that. We have prepared a plan which will include desilting of rivers, canals, try to expand their areas close to the original line of the rivers, and better management of river and reservoirs. We have floods one year and water scarcity, the next. Most of the rainwater goes waste into the sea. These issues are sadly neglected. MNM will provide a plan to solve all these issues,” he said.
Transportation issues and traffic chaos add to the problems of Chennai South. When asked how he proposes to handle such issues, Rangarajan said, “Not only the OMR and ECR areas, even the business districts of T. Nagar, Mylapore and Adyar are affected by traffic issues. We will provide an effective plan of traffic and transportation management, taking care of the present and future.”
“I have been brought up in Chennai and know all its issues well. I studied here and I work here. Our party knows how to address the issues facing Chennai,” he said confidently.
How is the response of the people to your new party? “There is overwhelming response to Kamal Sir and his approach to issues facing the people. People are looking for a change. They think the MNM is a genuine party. There are a lot of youngsters joining our party every day. Even during our campaigns,” said Rangarajan.
A problem for the party will be to convert goodwill into votes. When asked how they propose to do that, the MNM candidate said, “We have a good and enthusiastic machinery to convert goodwill into votes.”"

Will Sunny Leone conquer south through politics?,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/03/20/will-sunny-leone-conquer-south-through-politics/,"March 20, 2019",NT Bureau,Politics,"Actress Sunny Leone who has conquered hearts in Bollywood, is all set to rule South India through politics. If you are thinking she has entered DMK or AIADMK, that is not the case. The scintillating actress has been approached by a producer to play a politician for a Tamil flick.
Sunny is currently acting in a multi-lingual south film Veeramadevi, which is being directed by Vadivudaiyan. Now that film is almost over and is set to release, there is grapevine in the Tamil film industry that tells that the actress was approached to play a Tamilnadu politician and Vadivudaiyan will be the director of the next film too.
However, Sunny Leone fans must take this piece of news with a pinch of salt considering the fact that no official source has neither confirmed or denied this piece of information and neither has Sunny or Vadivudaiyan revealed anything on the same.
Be that as it may, it would be exciting to see Sunny Leone play a meaty role of a politician. Sunny is also part of cast for Mollywood superstar Mammootty’s upcoming film Madhura Raja. This will be the first time Sunny Leone will share screen-space with the south superstar."
Pained by dynasty politics allegations: Gowda,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/03/14/pained-by-dynasty-politics-allegations-gowda/,"March 14, 2019",NT Bureau,Politics,"Bengaluru: JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda yesterday broke down while launching the poll campaign of his grandson Prajwal Revanna in Hassan.
The whole event was an emotional event as the JDS family turned teary eyed when the former prime minister declared Prajwal as the candidate from Hassan constituency for the coming elections.
“…so many allegations, from morning in the media (they talk about) Deve Gowda, Revanna, Kumaraswamy and their sons,” said an emotional Gowda. There has been growing criticism that the JD(S) was involved in dynasty politics after both of Gowda’s grandsons NikilKumaraswamy and Prajwal Revanna were being fielded from party bastions of Mandya and Hassan, respectively, for the coming Lok Sabha polls.
Later speaking to reporters, Gowda said he was pained by the ‘dynasty politics’ allegations against them. He spoke about the controversy surrounding H D Kumaraswamy’s son Nikhil’s candidature in Mandya. A section of people began the ‘Nikhil Go Back’ campaign on social media. Talking about this, Gowda clarified that he didn’t announce Nikhil’s canditure, but it was a decision taken by JD(S) leaders. “…I will go to Mandya… let them shout go back… for whom I fought in last 60 years, I will place everything before the people of Mandya,” said an emotional Gowda.
BJP, however, hit out at Deve Gowda and called the whole thing an emotional episode as drama. There has been media reports that many JD(S) supporters were irked by the party leaders sidelining loyal workers and favouring family members instead.
BJP in its Twitter handle posted videos of Gowda and his family members getting emotional at the Hassan event and said that the first drama for the 2019 elections has began now. “If “CRYING” was an art Sri. @H_D_Devegowda & his family would hold the record for mastering the “Art Of Crying” to constantly fool people for decades. Matter of the fact is Before elections Deve Gowda & his family cries. After elections people who vote this family cries,” it said in another tweet."
Four Tamil movies that spoke about contemporary politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/03/11/four-tamil-movies-that-spoke-about-contemporary-politics/,"March 11, 2019",M BHARAT KUMAR,Politics,"Tamil cinema and politics are inseparable. The tinsel town gave five chief ministers to the State. From C N Annadurai, Karunanidhi, MGR, V N Janaki to Jayalalithaa, a lot of stars from Kollywood ended up ruling the State. The likes of Vijayakanth, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth are keen to leave their mark in politics.
The political situation, too, has been fluid in Tamilnadu ever since the demise of two powerful leaders – Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi. Cashing in on the opportunity, a few movies, based on contemporary politics, hit the screens recently. Also, a few are in the making. Bio-pic of Jayalalithaa is being made by two filmmakers, while Suriya starrer-NGK and Simbu’s Maanadu also speak politics.
News Today takes a look at these movies.
SARKAR
Directed by A R Murugadoss, Sarkar featured Vijay in the lead. A political film, it revolved around an NRI corporate, who comes to India to vote, only to learn that his vote has already been cast. While he reclaims his right legally, it also sets in motion a chain of events that eventually led him to entering the political fray, trying to change the system. The movie spoke against freebies and also touched upon the ruling AIADMK leading to protest in front of theatres. Eventually, it was re-censored and re-released with the controversial portions cut. Cases were also filed against the filmmaker.
NOTA
Featuring Arjun Reddy-fame Vijay Deverakonda in the lead, NOTA was directed by Anand Shankar. The bilingual flick had Nenjil Thunivirunthal-fame Mehreen Pirzaada in the female lead. The movie was about a youngster who becomes the Chief Minister with a vision to set things right in the State. The Chief Minister (Nasser), who is facing imprisonment in an illegal assets case, makes his son, Varun (Vijay Deverakonda) the temporary Chief Minister until his return. The disinterested young man gradually wakes up to the sorry state of affairs and tries to bring in change. The movie touched upon ‘resort’ politics and factionalism in political parties.
LKG
Written by actor RJ Balaji, who also enacted the lead, LKG was about a small-time politician who aspires to become the Chief Minister. Balaji played Lalgudi Karupaiah Gandhi a.k.a LKG, a councillor in the small town of Lalgudi, who manages to get elected as the head of the State. The influence of social media in politics was well highlighted. In a lighter vein, the movie took a dig at both the major political parties and also the situations after Jayalalithaa was hospitalised a couple of years ago. The movie was well-received by the audience. Priya Anand, Nanjil Sampath and J K Ritheesh acted in the movie.
ANNANUKKU JAI
A political satire, produced by national award-wining filmmaker Vettrimaran, it featured Vimal in the lead. Directed by Rajkumar, the movie was about the son of a toddy seller who decides to become a politician to take on a bar owner who tries to bring down his father. It threw light on how political parties use men who crave for power. An intense drama with fun elements interspersed, Annanukku Jai won the admiration of critics."

“I enjoyed the process of directing. Because fortunately, we didn’t have any major obstacle,” Prithviraj said.
“It pretty much went according to the plan. Before we started, we had a plan in place and that is how it happened. I completely enjoyed it. I have given my best shot and I hope the people like what they see,” he added. Tovino Thomas and Indrajith play crucial roles."

But, when it comes to hardcore politics, men continue to dominate in Tamilnadu, though there were a few exceptions like Jayalalithaa. With her demise shattering the hopes of wannabe women politicos in the State, the upcoming Lok Sabha elections have brought to the fore a bunch of female politicians. These women are there in the political field for a while, but their presence is now felt in a never before way, in the run-up to the Parliamentary polls.
Kanimozhi
From Karunanidhi’s daughter to poet to accused in 2G case to Rajya Sabha MP, Kanimozhi’s journey is full of ups and downs. She is said to be the DMK’s candidate in Thoothukudi.
Already, her supporters are demanding a bigger role for her in the party and some of them are even dreaming of Deputy Prime Minister post for Kani. But, she is non-commital about anything and says ‘the DMK-Congress combine will sweep the polls’.
Tamilisai Soundararajan
It’s a big question whether anyone else would have tolerated criticism like Tamilisai Soundararajan did. Hailing from a Congress family, the gynecologist is now at the helm of BJP’s Tamilnadu unit.
Targeted personally than politically by meme-makers, this ‘Akka’ takes bouquets and brickbats alike. She is likely to contest against Kanimozhi in Thoothukudi.
Nirmala Sitharaman
India’s first woman Defence Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman was born in Madurai and studied in Tiruchi and Chennai, before she moved to Delhi.
Once tipped as the BJP’s Chief Ministerial candidate for Tamilnadu, Nirmala still oversees the party’s affairs in her home-State. The recent IAF strike on terror bases in Pakistan earned her brownie points and some criticism, too.
Premalatha
‘Lady Captain’ of DMDK, Premalatha is the de facto head of the DMDK, due to the failing health of her husband Vijayakanth. ‘Anniyar’ to supporters, Premalatha is known for her firm handling of party and alliance affairs.
According to reports, the Rajya Sabha seat demanded by the DMDK, “during its talks with the AIADMK and the DMK,” was for Premalatha.
Vanathi Srinivasan
A prominent face of Tamilnadu unit of Bharatiya Janata Party, vociferous Vanathi is good at not just debates, but field-work too. The State general secretary is in-charge of reaching out to voters in a sizeable number of constituencies. This time, she is expected to be fielded from the Kongu region.
Khushbu & Tamilachi
While actress Khusbu Sundar, the national spokesperson of Congress, is said to be one of the 10 candidates of her party in Tamilnadu, poet Tamilachi Thangapandian, daughter of DMK veteran Thangapandian and sister of former Minister Thangam Thennarasu, has filed application seeking a DMK ticket."

Makkal Needhi Maiam founder, actor-politician Kamal Haasan, who was in New Delhi to talk to CPI(M) politburo member Prakash Karat for a possible tie-up, is said to have returned empty-handed. Speaking about the talks, CPI(M) Tamilnadu secretary K Balakrishnan said in Chidambaram that the party turned down his request.
He said Karat impressed upon him the need for a strong alliance in every State to bring down the BJP government at the Centre and that they had already tied up with the DMK and Congress in Tamilnadu. Also, he pointed out that the alliance talks were finalised even as early as December.
Karat is supposed to have assured Kamal that they would continue to be friends.

“I am happy to see that he has recovered very well after his treatment (in the United States). Along with all the people of Tamilnadu, we pray for his long life and good health in the service of the people…” he said.
The BJP had earlier in the day stitched up an alliance with the ruling AIADMK for the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP was given 5 seats among the 33 available in Tamilnadu and Puducherry constituencies after the PMK was allotted seven seats."
Tongue twisters of Tamilnadu politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/02/19/tongue-twisters-of-tamilnadu-politics/,"February 19, 2019",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"M K Stalin
Chennai: To err is human, especially during public speeches. But, in Tamilnadu, where the gift of gab is considered an important ingredient to climb political ladder, each and every word uttered by politicians is under scanner. And, when they misspell something, they get instantly trolled on social media with multitudes of memes.
The recent toast of meme-makers is DMK president M K Stalin. At a recent function, he attempted to say “When I was Deputy Chief Minister I went to Japan” (for Metro Rail project). But he ended up saying “When I was Deputy Chief Minister of Japan”.
This small slip of tongue was enough for netizens to create hashtags, memes and posts, all mocking Stalin for his words.
Interestingly, this is not first time for Stalin to get trolled for spelling something wrong. His earlier gems include ‘Yaanai varum munne, mani osai varum pinne’ (which is the exact opposite of a popular Tamil proverb he intended to convey), ‘poonai mel madhil‘ (he wanted to say ‘madhil mel poonai‘ which means ‘cat on the wall’) and a “vacuum is filed as it is cried” (instead of ‘a vacuum is filled when it is created’).
Dindigul Srinivasan
Minister Dindigul Srinivasan was also the darling of trollers on social media. He once said “Prime Minister MGR”.
His gapless gaffes include “the Budget tabled by Vajpayee had been welcomed by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami”, “Deputy Speaker Thambidurai would go to New Delhi and speak with Prime Minister Narasimha Rao”.
When BJP president Amit Shah was in Chennai last year, the party’s National secretary H Raja’s Tamil translation of drip irrigation as urine irrigation (siruneer pasanam) had evoked huge trolls and fun posts in social media.
H Raja
While Chief Minister Palaniswami once said “Kamba Ramayanam was penned by Sekkizhar” and attracted memes, senior members of his Cabinet, including Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and School Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan, were not able to get the name of popular Carnatic singer Sudha Raghunathan right at a programme. They called her Bharathanatyam dancer, Sudha Rangunathan and Sudha Raguraman.
“While M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa gave huge importance to their public speeches and did enough homework before attending any event, politicos these days are not much bothered about this. They should prepare well to avoid becoming meme-materials,” says E Ramachandran, a political observer."

"I am already in politics, says Udhayanidhi Stalin",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/02/18/i-am-already-in-politics-says-udhayanidhi-stalin/,"February 18, 2019",M BHARAT KUMAR,Politics,"Chennai: “Politics is not new to me. I have accompanied my thatha and appa to several meetings. I follow all political happenings very closely. Today, I am just a member of the party and go about my work to strengthen it,” says actor and son of DMK president M K Stalin, Udhayanidhi Stalin.
The grandson of former chief minister M Karunanidhi, Udhayanidhi’s passion for cinema is obvious for it is in his genes. He inherited his grandfather’s legacy and chose to produce films initially. He soon ventured into acting and began a successful journey with Oru Kal Oru Kannadi. It was followed by a string of successful outings as hero that included films like Manithan and Nimir. A busy actor, producer and distributor, Udhayanidhi is also a full-time politician today. In an exclusive interview to News Today, he shared thoughts about his upcoming films, political plans and a lot more. Excerpts:
Q: How difficult is it to dabble in acting, production and politics at the same time?
A: At Red Giant Movies, we have a strong team of experts. They watch movies. Identify the best and all I have to do is finally take a decision. Similarly, we have the right set of people in our production team. And, currently, I am working in a couple of films bankrolled by other production houses. Politics is not tough since I grew up in that atmosphere. I was always amazed at the hard work of my grandfather and father: that inspires me to go meet more people.
Q: What did you learn from Karunanidhi & Stalin?
A: I don’t find much difference. Appa is hardworking. It was a privilege when my grandfather acknowledged my father as someone who spends all 24 hours for the development of the State. From my dad, I learnt to push myself hard to serve. From my grandfather, I learnt the importance to reach out to the masses and understand their needs and sufferings. He was a voracious reader. Today, reading habit has come down drastically after the advent of technology. I want to rekindle the habit. Wherever I go, people gift me books, which I donate to libraries. My love for language was nourished by my grandfather. After his meetings, he used to dictate his speech for Murasoli. On several occasions, I was the proof reader for the copies. His words always had a great impact on me.
Q: When are you entering electoral politics?
A: I was never away from politics. I have accompanied my thatha and appa to several meetings. I have been involving myself closely in politics and meeting more and more people to understand their problems. There were even rumours that I would be fielded as DMK candidate for Tiruvarur by-polls. That was because cadres, out of their love for me, filed applications in my name for the contest. I am just a member of the party and go about my work to strengthen it. It is my duty to carry the good deeds of Karunanidhi and dreams and aspirations of MK Stalin to all the people. Whatever the party asks me to do, I am ready to do it.
Q: Can you sum up the political situation in the State today?
A: It is pathetic and has gone from bad to worse. Especially the last three years have been bad. After Jayalalithaa’s demise, we see a vacuum in terms of leadership there. Lots of  drama is happening between the AIADMK and BJP to stitch an alliance. The State party is dancing to the tunes of the BJP.
Q: How do you handle criticism?
A: If it is made in the right manner, I would lend ear to it. After OKOK, when many said I dance bad, I took it as a challenge and worked day and night to get it right. Today, on social media, there are a few comments made with the sole intention to disturb you. For someone who comes from a political family, criticism is not new.
Q: Is your upcoming release Kanne Kalaimanae an off-beat entertainer?
A: It is a rural tale. A different genre. A Seenu Ramasamy film. Thankfully, my performance in Nimir (a remake of Malayalm hit Maheshinte Prathikaaram) convinced him to do such a film with me. Priyadharshan insisted that I look more real and render a live performance in Manithan.  Similarly, Kanne  Kalaimane will have no artificial elements.  I have learnt a lot working with Priyan and Seenu Ramasamy.
Q: Are you keen on doing village-based stories?
A: Saravanan Irukka Bayamen was targetted at B and C Centres. It was a typical Ezhil’s commercial entertainer. But a film like Nimir or Kanne Kalaimanae will have class elements in it. Whatever I try to do, I surrender myself fully to my director. I just want to deliver what they want. I would say that I want to come out of my comfort zone. After OKOK , many thought I would fit only for one particular genre. May be a cocktail of comedy, romance, a kuthu number post-interval. I took it as a challenge and today I am here exploring various other possibilities. It all depends on how hard you work and the dedication you show towards your work.
Q: How your life changed post-OKOK’s success?
A: My confidence level increased. But it threw many challenges. I had fear standing before the camera then. But today, I have started to enjoy my work. I feel more relaxed now. I am glad that my films are received well by the people.
Q: Will Udhay bid goodbye to cinema for politics?
A: I don’t think so. I can manage both. I would love to do two or three films a year after carefully selecting the scripts that come my way. As a DMK cadre, I will always be there to contribute towards strengthening my party.
Q: How do you see the status of Tamil film industry today?
A: Sadly, it is ridden with lots of diseases. Artistes salary have gone up several-fold in the last eight years. Above all, piracy has emerged an open threat to survival of the film industry. It is time some strong decisions are arrived at and ensure the industry is saved."
Explained: How Palaniswami proved he is Dhoni of TN politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/02/15/explained-how-palaniswami-proved-he-is-dhoni-of-tn-politics/,"February 15, 2019",Balasubramani Muniyandi,Politics,"Chennai: Today, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has successfully completed two years in office. When the announcement about his becoming Chief Minister was made in 2017, many were surprised. And there were many others who predicted that his government would not last long. But, Palaniswami has proved his critics wrong.
His rise and present form can be compared to that of Indian cricketer M S Dhoni whose elevation as the T20 captain in 2007 came as a surprise to many. Like Dhoni, Palaniswami too has paced his innings steadily in the beginning and started hitting his shots after settling down.
Though the first year of Palaniswami’s tenure was filled with opposition and uncertainty, he weathered them with patience to make it to the second year and since then has been leaving his stamp in many areas. To put it in the words of AIADMK MLA S Semmalai, Palaniswami has been hitting sixes in recent times. He has been soft and stern, depending on the situation.
His announcement of Rs 1,000 as Pongal gift and Rs 2,000 for people living below the poverty line is seen as a master stroke by political pundits. Palaniswami has often boasted that this government is run for farmers by a farmer and said 23 lakh farmers have taken up crop insurance.
Ever since Palaniswami became Chief Minister, there have been plenty of protests in the State, the latest being by members of JACTTO-GEO. However, the way in which he handled the situation was lauded by many. The announcement about plastic ban and its implementation from 1 January 2019 is another feather in Palaniswami’s cap.
THIS AND THAT
Palaniswami lent a helping hand when neighbouring Kerala was reeling under water but was also quick to object to the Kerala government’s proposal to construct a new Mullaiperiyar dam. He also stood his ground in the Mekedatu issue and objected to the Karnataka government constructing a reservoir across the Cauvery at that point.
Recently, he said legal action will be taken to ensure that Andhra Pradesh does not construct check-dams across the Palar river.
HE MEANS BUSINESS
At a time when there was talk that Tamilnadu had become hostile to industries, the Palaniswami-led government successfully completed the second edition of Global Investors Meet during which 304 MoUs were signed entailing investments of over Rs 3,00,431 crore.
FACING GAJA
The government’s swift action and preparations during Gaja cyclone were appreciated even by the Opposition parties, including arch rival DMK. Palaniswami announced that one lakh concrete houses will be built for those who lost their houses to the cyclone.
STERLITE ALRIGHT
After the firing during the 100th day of the Thoothukudi Sterlite protest, Palaniswami defended the action of the police saying that the they resorted to firing only because the protests had turned violent. He also ordered a probe into the incident by a retired judge. The government stood its ground by closing down the Sterlite Industries and not allowing it to reopen.
WHAT LIES AHEAD
The big test for the AIADMK will be the upcoming Lok Sabha election. The party has called for nominations for all the 40 constituencies (39 in Tamilnadu and 1 in Puducherry).
THE P FACTOR
Though rumours often surface that there is a rift between Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, they both have strongly maintained that not even a tsunami can separate their partnership. Both the leaders have been hand in hand to helm the government and party, respectively."
You need ‘certificates’ from ‘specialists’ if you want to enter TN politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/02/13/you-need-certificates-from-specialists-if-you-want-to-enter-tn-politics/,"February 13, 2019",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"Chennai: Want to become a politician in Tamilnadu? And wondering what the basic qualifications are? Well, to start with, you have to get the following certificates from the following people / parties – community certificate from the DMK, nativity certificate from Naam Tamizhar Katchi’s Seeman and nationality certificate from BJP leader H Raja.
Kamal Haasan
Even if you don’t apply, they will voluntarily give you one the moment you cross their path. For instance, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which was fine with Kamal Haasan floating a party, meeting people (or voters) across Tamilnadu and hitting out at the AIADMK and the BJP, felt offended all of a sudden after the actor-politician called the party corrupt.
What followed was an acerbic article in DMK’s mouthpiece Murasoli, gifting sobriquets like donkey and ox (boom boom maadu) to Kamal. What was more stinging was the manner it slammed him by underlining his caste. The ‘Ulaga Nayagan’, who took pride many a time in openly declaring that he had disowned his Brahminical roots and always claimed himself a Periyariite and a rationalist, was criticised by Murasoli that his true colours had started to show up.
Seeman
Stating that ‘something which was attached to his birth cannot be changed’ and “he is cheating his followers by approaching politics in the same way as he has done over his roles in movies”, the article also ‘praised’ him as a BJP agent.
Seeman, who himself is said to be having his roots in Kerala, has this habit of checking the mother tongue of his rivals. According to him, you have either to be a non-Tamil or an anti-Tamil if you criticise him.
H Raja
Worse, he has started issuing nativity certificates even to Gods. While Murugan and His father Sivan are his muppattans (forefathers), “other Hindu Gods are not from the Tamil land”. But, he apparently doesn’t have any problem with Jesus Christ and Allah.
Raja, the darling of netizens, calls as anti-Indian whoever is opposed to the BJP. From meme-makers to bomb-makers, no one has escaped from his ‘anti-Indian’ jibe. Actors, too, are no exception, as it was Raja who was instrumental in creating awareness among many about the religion of artistes like Vijay."
Congress asks CPI(M) to shed politics of violence for talks,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/02/11/congress-asks-cpim-to-shed-politics-of-violence-for-talks/,"February 11, 2019",NT Bureau,Politics,"Mullappally Ramachandran 
Thiruvananthapuram: “If CPI(M) is ready to shed politics of violence and its Stalinist thoughts, Congress is ready for an open discussion to form a secular democratic front to fight fascism,” said Kerala Congress chief Mullappally Ramachandran on Sunday.
Speaking during his Janamaha Yathra at Malappuram, he said the CPI(M) saw Congress as the main opposition and not the BJP and it would not be possible for the CPI(M) to create a Left alternative at the national-level. He further said to fight fascist forces, the Kerala CPI(M) should accept the party’s Bengal and Tripura units’ decision.
His remarks, however, did not go down well with the other members of the party. Former chief and MLA K Muraleedharan rubbished the statement and said the Congress could do well without the help of the CPI (M).
However, the CPI(M) slammed his remarks, saying that it doesn’t require the co-operation of Congress and that it had policies similar to that of the BJP. It is to be noted that thehe Congress and the CPI(M) have been in a bitter fight in Kerala for decades."
Dy’nasty’ politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/02/11/dynasty-politics/,"February 11, 2019",NT Bureau,Politics,"We are no more ruled by kings. But, still, the system unofficially exists in the country, with many parties and leaders promoting the next-gen of their families. Taking a dig at it Sunday during his Tirupur visit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dubbed the Opposition alliance as ‘Maha adulteration’ and said people of Tamilnadu and the whole country knew very well about it. He added that it was a ‘club of rich people trying to promote their dynasties’. ‘They neither understand poverty nor have vision to serve the poor. Their aim is to spread panic and time and again try to mislead the farmers, workers and the younger generation of the nation,’ he said.
Stating that earlier there were family packs in ice creams and mobile charges, Modi said now there are family packs for bails. He also said the ten per cent quota for poor sections in the general category would provide equality of opportunity for all. “Let us keep our mind full of positivity and commitment to serve the poor and in that spirit we are working tirelessly to create an India where our children have good education, elderly affordable medicine, young people more opportunities and farmers proper irrigation,” he said. Stating that growth and development should not be limited to a particular group, he said, “May there be progress and prosperity everywhere.”
Dynasty politics, prevalent from national to regional parties, is against the very idea of democracy. Though the Bharatiya Janata Party is better in this, compared to others, it too is facing allegations of some leaders promoting their wards. With the Lok Sabha elections fast approaching, there can be no better time than this for the BJP to set an example. It should not give tickets to scions of its leaders and should bring ‘one family, one post’ system. If done, this would sure attract more votes towards the BJP."

Taking a trip down to the past, he shared his experiences on singing for Ilayaraja.
Kamal Haasan said, “It was Ilayaraja who advised me to enter politics and serve the people. It was a secret until now.”
Ilayaraja, who did not refute it, using a musical idiom, said laughingly, “When did I ask you to come and when have you come?”

Annadurai to Thambidurai: Rise & fall of rebels in Tamilnadu politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/01/26/annadurai-to-thambidurai-rise-fall-of-rebels-in-tamilnadu-politics/,"January 26, 2019",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"Annadurai and Periyar
Annadurai and Karunanidhi
Chennai:  Leaders, cadres & rebels. Tamilnadu’s politics is made up of these three sets. If Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai is now speaking against AIADMK forging an alliance with the BJP, a stand which is not that of his party (as clarified by Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar, who has emerged as the de facto spokesperson of the government and the AIADMK), it is in his political genes. For all we know and do not know, Thambidurai may be a pro tem rebel, but TN has  a history of such protesters turning protagonists.
It was C N Annadurai’s rebellion against his mentor and Dravidar Kazhagam founder E V Ramasamy a.k.a. Periyar that led to the formation of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. The friction between the two erupted when Periyar married Maniammai, who was much younger than him. Angered by this action of Periyar, Anna, with his supporters, parted ways with the DK and launched his own party.
Karunanidhi and MGR
Three years after Annadurai’s death, M G Ramachandran (MGR), the star leader of the DMK, left the party, then led by M Karunanidhi, to form his own kazhagam — the AIADMK. This happened after MGR was expelled by the leadership, as he, in a public meeting, asked for the financial details of the party to be publicised, which enraged the DMK top gun.
Jayalalithaa
After the demise of MGR, the AIADMK saw a split with the emergence of factions led by his wife V N Janaki and J Jayalalithaa. But the one led by Jayalalithaa emerged triumphant and remained as the all-powerful AIADMK till Jayalalithaa breathed her last, barring exceptions of rebellions by S Thirunavukkarasar (MGR ADMK), R M Veerappan (MGR Kazhagam) and the likes.
Karunanidhi saw a major threat to his party when Vaiko (V Gopalsamy then) floated the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. With a sizeable number of district satraps switching over to the MDMK, Karunanidhi faced a jolt. But his storming back to power in 1996 rewrote the DMK’s fortunes. Even after that, there were voices of discontent in the DMK in the form of T Rajendhar and Karunanidhi’s elder son M K Alagiri. But, nothing could harm the party and its apparatus.
Thambidurai
The AIADMK, post the death of Jayalalithaa, saw too many branches thanks to V K Sasikala, O Panneerselvam, Edappadi K Palaniswami, T T V Dhinakaran, Deepa Jayakumar, her husband Madhavan, Dhivakaran and Baskaran. Ministers and leaders gathered guts to air their views openly, and Thambidurai is one among them. He may not be an Annadurai. But, will he emerge a Thookudurai*?

TN’s 10-year challenge: Key changes witnessed in politics 2009-2019,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/01/21/tns-10-year-challenge-key-changes-witnessed-in-politics-2009-2019/,"January 21, 2019",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"Chennai: With the #10YearChallenge that is about posting photos of individuals from 2009 and from today, to check their physical changes, taking the social media by storm, how about a similar exercise for Tamilnadu from the political angle, for the State’s politics witnessed a sea change in the last decade?
In 2009, politics of TN was centered on just two person(alitie)s – M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa. Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister and Jayalalithaa was the supremo of the main Opposition party. In fact, since 1989, the musical chair of power was occupied by these two leaders and it continued till 2016, barring two brief stints by O Panneerselvam when Jayalalithaa had to quit the post due to court verdicts. Even on those occasions, ‘Amma’ was only believed to be ruling the State as ‘Makkal Mudhalvar’.
But, her hospitalisation in September 2016 and demise in December ended with Tamilnadu witnessing two Chief Ministers till date – Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami. And, of course, V K Sasikala, Jayalalithaa’s close aide, was almost set to become the CM in early 2017, but missed the top post by a whisker, after she was convicted in the infamous disproportionate assets case.
Before going to the Parapana Agrahara jail (where, as a latest probe report claims, she had received preferential treatment, including specially cooked food and access to special cells), she made Palaniswami Chief Minister, who has since then proved that he is master survivor.
Coming to the party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which saw a split, was reunited after EPS and OPS joined forces in 2017. But, Sasikala’s nephew T T V Dhinakaran, who was expelled from the party along with his aunt, floated AMMK and also emerged victorious in R K Nagar by-election in December 2017.
The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, floated by C N Annadurai, was helmed by his ‘thambi’ Karunanidhi for a record five-decades till August last year when he breathed his last. Though his demise did not create many ripples in the party, compared to Jayalalithaa’s death, M K Stalin, after facing little protest from his elder brother M K Alagiri, became the president of the DMK. He is also the Leader of Opposition, with the DMK commanding a strength of 89 legislators.
The past decade has not been so good for the DMK. While it was in power in the State and the Centre in 2009, the party lost the 2011 Assembly elections, 2014 Lok Sabha polls and 2016 Assembly elections. Vijayakanth, a rising star in politics during the start of this decade, faded due to his ill-health and is currently undergoing treatment in the United States. His son, Vijay Prabhakar, is now rising in the DMDK.
Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, top stars of Tamil cinema, openly admitted their political ambitions. While Rajini is yet to float a party, Kamal launched Makkal Needhi Maiam in early 2018.
The tenure of local body representatives expired in 2016 and civic elections have not been conducted since.
While these are the main changes witnessed in the Tamilnadu political arena in the last 10 years, there are certain things that did not change — the fate of parties like the MDMK, PMK, BJP, Congress, VCK, CPI and CPI(M). And, that is a different challenge."

END OF AN ERA
DMK stalwart and former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi (94), who had a public life that spanned over seven decades, died 7 August after prolonged illness. A host of national leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi paid their last respects to Karunanidhi. He was laid to rest near the Marina Beach after the High Court settled a bitter row with the government over his memorial in the DMK’s favour.
STALIN’S RISE
M K Stalin, long considered Karunanidhi’s political heir, consolidated his position by scripting a smooth takeover of the DMK, frustrating a bid by his estranged elder brother M K Alagiri, who was expelled from the party years ago by their father.
Putting to rest speculations of a possible thaw in the DMK’s ties with the BJP, Karunanidhi’s son Stalin, who took over the reins of the party after his death, made a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him ‘fascist’ at a party event that was attended by a galaxy of opposition leaders.
He plumped for long-time ally Congress president Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the opposition, but the proposal did not find any takers from national
opposition parties and regional outfits.
GOVT STAYS STRONG
The ruling AIADMK led by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami weathered many a political storm as it saw off the second year since the demise of Jayalalithaa, despite doomsday predictions by rebels and arch rival DMK.
The party won a key legal dispute when the Madras High Court upheld the disqualification of its 18 MLAs who had sided with sacked leader TTV Dhinakaran in a bid to topple the Palaniswami government.
CBI PROBE
The Palaniswami government suffered a set back when the Madras High Court ordered a CBI probe into the infamous Gutkha scam in which Health Minister C Vijaya Baskar, Director General of Police TK Rajendran and others were questioned.
PROTEST & CRITICISM
The police firing in Thoothukudi on the people who were protesting against the Sterlite Copper plant, also brought several criticisms for the government. The government ordered the permanent closure of the plant, but the National Green Tribunal set aside the action.
NEW IN FRAY
New actors emerged on Tamilnadu’s political stage that was dominated for decades by Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, with veteran filmstar Kamal Haasan launching his party Makkal Needhi Maiam in February.
His contemporary in the film industry superstar Rajinikanth, however, kept his fans guessing about the timing of his party’s launch a year after he announced his decision to take the political plunge. Meanwhile, Dhinakaran floated his own party Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam.
MYSTERY CONTINUES
The inquiry by the one-man judicial commission into the death of Jayalalithaa picked up pace with a host of people, including officials and doctors, making depositions. It is said the commission will submit its probe report on 24 February 2019.
MEKEDATU ISSUE
The vexed Cauvery issue reared its head again with the State moving the Supreme Court against the Centre’s consent for preparing a detailed project report for constructing a dam at Mekedatu proposed by Karnataka, drawing protests in Tamilnadu.

The 37-year-old World Cup winner walked into the sunset by scoring a memorable 100 in his farewell Ranji Trophy match against Andhra at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground here.
“Not at all,” Gambhir said when asked if he was contesting in the next general elections. “There are rumours, which I have heard as well, probably the reason is maybe I take up social issues as well… For me Twitter was always a platform which is very, very important and where I take up social issues. I am not that kind of a character where I am going to start joking on a platform like Twitter as well. For me, being a citizen of this country, it is my right to take up social issues and that probably is the reason why people think I am going to join politics but there is nothing of that sort.”
Gambhir last played for the country in 2016 against England in Rajkot. “As I just mentioned, I haven’t even thought about it (politics) and it is a completely different field. For 25 I have not done anything else, so let’s see what I am going to do.”
Gambhir scored 4,154 runs in Test cricket from 58 matches, 5,238 runs in ODIs and 932 in T20Is. He was also asked if he is keen on taking up coaching assignments in competitive cricket, and he sounded positive.
“One thing which excites me is action and I am sure action is not about sitting in those AC rooms doing commentary and stuff. I don’t know if I am going to be as good a coach as I have been a player,” Gambhir said.
“I will have to evaluate whether I can be successful as a coach. Let’s see, if that comes around and if I feel that I have the energy, passion and if I have the commitment to do it, I will think about it.”
He responded in the negative when asked if he will enter cricket administration at some point. “I am too straightforward a person to be in administration, I don’t think people will accept me anywhere,” said Gambhir, who has distributed all his bats to his team-mates, leaving his ‘kit bag empty’.
Gambhir said he is willing to help young players in Delhi cricket. “I am still a government nominee, hopefully, I can now try and contribute more (since he is no longer a player). There won’t be any conflict of interest, which is very important and there won’t be any criticism as well because when I took this up there was a lot of criticism. The boys need a lot of good things in DDCA (Delhi District and Cricket Association) and hopefully I am able to put that word across the executive committee and get those things done from the cricket point of view. Apart from that, my job is to get the best out of the boys.”"
Will Rajini speak politics Sunday at ‘Petta’ audio launch?,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/12/08/will-rajini-speak-politics-sunday-at-petta-audio-launch/,"December 8, 2018",M BHARAT KUMAR,Politics,"Chennai: Come tomorrow, it is time for Rajinikanth fans to celebrate and rejoice. The music album of Petta will be launched with great fanfare at a gala event at Sairam college, near Chennai.
All eyes are on Rajinikanth as he is expected to attend the event. Political pundits are hoping that the actor would throw more light on his political aspirations at the event as almost a year ago, he had announced that he would venture into politics and float his own party. He had even said his party would contest all 234 Assembly constituencies in the next elections.
Petta, starring Rajinikanth, has music by R Anirudh. Directed by Karthik Subbaraj and produced by Sun Pictures, the movie stars Simran, Trisha, Vijay Sethupathi, Bobby Simha, Nawazuddin Siddiqui.
Close on the heels of the single Marana Mass (sung by Anirudh and S P Balasubrahmanyam) released recently from the movie, came another single, Ullaallaa, yesterday.
Said Anirudh in a sneak peek video, “I was inspired by a scene in Rajinikanth’s 1981 comedy Thillu Mullu in which his character Indiran lies to his boss to go watch a football match. A ‘Baila’ tune played during this scene. I tried to recreate it in Ullaallaa.’"

The film, which released last year went on to garner rave reviews among both critics and the audience. While the first part is all about how a district collector rescues a little girl from a deep borewell, the sequel of the film will be an out and out political thriller.
Sources say that unlike the previous part, Nayanthara will not be playing the role of a collector. Instead, she will be playing a politician. Aramm 2 is about how corrupt politicians force her to resign her  job, which prompts her to start a political party.
In fact, the film will take on many contemporary social issues and has dialogues criticising political parties in Tamilnadu."
Resort politics returns to TN: TTV camp MLAs in Courtallam,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/10/23/resort-politics-returns-to-tn-ttv-camp-mlas-in-courtallam/,"October 23, 2018",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"File photo of Thanga Tamilselvan.
Chennai: While this is the season of sequels in Tamil cinema thanks to Tamizh Padam 2, Vishwaroopam 2, Saamy Square, Sandakozhi 2 and 2.0, it is also the time for a sequel in Tamilnadu politics. Nearly after two years, the second round of ‘resort politics’ has resumed.
If it was Koovathur on ECR during February 2017 when Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had to prove his majority in the Assembly, the venue this time is a resort at Courtallam.
In anticipation of the verdict in a case related to their disqualification, 18 legislators supporting Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) leader T T V Dhinakaran are staying in the Courtallam resort. This morning, they participated in the Thamirabharani Pushkaram and had a holy dip.
“We are sure that the verdict will come in our favour. We prayed for that in the Pushkaram. We will take rest in the resort for a day or two and go back to Chennai after that,” said Thanga Tamilselvan, one of the 18 disqualified MLAs.

Sources in the AMMK said Dhinakaran is hopeful that the court would strike down the disqualification of the legislators supporting him. “This might result in the ruling dispensation poaching the MLAs by various means. To prevent that, he has asked them to stay together in the resort and heavy security arrangements have been made. Each and every movement is being recorded.”
Apart from the 18 disqualified MLAs, three more legislators – Prabhu (Kallakurichi), V T Kalaiselvan (Vriddhachalam) and Rathinasabapathy (Aranthangi) are also said to be supporting Dhinakaran. “Wait and watch. More MLAs will come to us after the judgement and the days of the EPS-OPS regime are numbered. We are the real AIADMK and TTV will soon take over the party,” says a confident Dhinakaran camp.
But the AIADMK is equally hopeful. “It is the habit of Dhinakaran and his men to make such claims. Right from the day he was removed from the (deputy general secretary) post, he has been predicting the fall of the government, but nothing has happened so far. The party and the government are safe in the hands of Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam. Let the HC verdict come,” says a senior leader in the ruling party.
THIRD EYE
The eighteen MLAs were disqualified by Speaker P Dhanapal under the Anti-Defection Act in September 2017. In June this year, the High Court delivered a split verdict, referring the case to a third judge, Justice M Sathyanarayanan, who is expected to give his judgement soon."

Speaking to mediapersons at Papanasam today, Chandrasekar argued that there was nothing wrong if somebody who has been elevated by the people wanted to do some good for them.
As a Tamilian, I wish for Vijay to do good for people by entering politics, said his father. According to him, some people were scared to see the actor wanting to become a politician.
In Chennai, during the recent audio launch of his latest film, Sarkar – which itself is a suggestive title – Vijay dropped broad hints about entering politics. He made some leading statements like ‘if I become chief minister, I will stop acting’ and concentrate fully on tackling the problems of the people."
"Jaya’s ‘nephew’ to enter politics, holds talks with Rajini",https://newstodaynet.com/2018/10/10/jayas-nephew-to-enter-politics-holds-talks-with-rajini/,"October 10, 2018",Balasubramani Muniyandi,Politics,"Chennai: M V Rakesh, who claims himself to be the nephew of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa and a data scientist working in Bengaluru, today said he will be contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Trichy.
In an interview to News Today, Rakesh said his uncle N J Vasudevan is the ‘step elder brother’ of Jayalalithaa.
He said that his move to contest in the election is basically to promote and implement the SWIM (S – Skill based education, W – Waldorf education system, I – Indian value-based education,
M – Market based education education) system innovated by him.
“I want to bring personalisation in the education system. Hailling from a slum area, I know the difficulties that students undergo. Each student is unique and everyone has a different dream. My education system will help in identifying that dream and assist them in pursuing it,” he said and added that he has got copyright from the government of India for this ‘invention’.
“I do not want to sell this system to private schools and want it to be implemented in the government schools. I feel that entering politics is the only way to do it. Former President APJ Abdul Kalam too had a similar vision,” he said.
He further said he is a spiritual and technical person and has decided to contest the election only from Trichy for spiritual reasons.
“After knowing about my work through my firm Techism, Kannada actor and politician Upendra called me and gave me a seat to contest on behalf of his party Prajakeeya from Mysuru. However, unfortunately, he dissolved his party. Following this, I have spoken to Rajinikanth. I am yet to receive a response from him and I will meet him again,” he said.
Talking about his political stand, the 28-year-old said, he believes every youngster should come forward and contest in the election and should not be intimidated by the present day politicians.
“I must also admit that I am not all that happy to use Jayalalithaa’s background to enter politics. Though I am from her family, I am open to join any party which is ready to field me in Trichy and accept my idea. I sincerely hope that in the future, youngsters without any political background should contest in the elections and emerge victorious,” he said.
Talking about his election strategy and winning chances, Rakesh said,”I am new to politics and I have not formulated a strategy yet. I am aware of the challenges that I have to face. I feel that the good deeds of a person will help him win in politics and I feel that I have exposure to the problems faced by the people. With my technical knowledge and spiritual conscience, I will be able to solve them. The ultimate aim is to win the election but I would also be happy if more youngsters are inspired by me to contest in the polls,” he added."

But in real life, if I become the Chief Minister, I won’t be acting. I will perform the role with honesty,” said actor Vijay.
Speaking at a function here on Tuesday, he said, “Hypothetically speaking, if I became a Chief Minister, I want to eradicate corruption.”
He said in a lighter vein, “Usually they form a party, contest elections and form government (Sarkar). But we have made Sarkar and will be contesting elections.”
“When I meet you fans at such events, I feel overjoyed. Thanks, AR Rahman sir for doing this film. Your association with this film is like Sarkar bagging an Oscar,” Vijay said.
He added, “If the leader is just, the government will flourish. But it just takes time.” At the event, fans cheered Vijay whenever he spoke about contemporary politics and said that there is an urgent need to weed out corruption.
Speaking to News Today, a die-hard fan of the actor, Ramesh said, “We are happy as our Thalapathy has hinted that he would enter politics. It is a joyous occasion.”
He added, “There is a political vacuum in in the State and Vijay will fill it.” Remember Vijay has supported causes such as jallikattu. He even visited the house of medical aspirant Anita, who had killed herself as she could not pass the NEET exam.
Vijay’s father, S A Chandrasekhar, had earlier admitted in an interview that Vijay has plans to enter politics."

What makes north Chennai hotbed of politics & power?,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/29/what-makes-north-chennai-hotbed-of-politics-power/,"August 29, 2018",M Bhaskar Sai,Politics,"Chennai: Like North Chennai films, the politics surrounding the area too is racy, full of twists and is mostly about one-upmanship. With AIADMK presidium chairman E Madhusudhanan, a strongman from the locality, triggering a fresh controversy by making charges against Minister and party senior D Jayakumar over the recently-concluded cooperatives elections, let’s check out what makes North Madras a hotbed of high voltage action.
HARBOUR
The Chennai port and the fishing harbours close to it provide livelihood to lakhs of families. The money and the pride involved in wielding clout over these men and material cannot be explained in words, say old-timers, recalling gang wars of those days.
Cut to present, MLAs, Minister(s) and other representatives from these areas call the shots and hence, there is always a fight for power. The Assembly constituency itself is named Harbour and it was represented in the House by heavyweights like M Karunanidhi, K Anbazhagan, Pala Karuppiah and P K Sekar Babu
ROYAPURAM
It was at Robinson Park on Royapuram’s Cemetry Road where the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was founded by C N Annadurai. Hence, Royapuram, known for its crowded roads, closely-packed buildings and poor infrastructure, has a special place in the history of Dravidian politics. Represented multiple times in the State Assembly by D Jayakumar (sitting MLA and Minister), Royapuram constituency is dominated by ordinary people whose main job is fishing.
PERAMBUR
A mini-India that houses people from various States thanks to its proximity to Railway establishments, Perambur was a Communist stronghold till 2016, when P Vetrivel of the AIADMK tasted victory (he is however now one of the 18 MLAs who were disqualified for supporting TTV Dhinakaran). In the past, Perambur had sent prominent personalities like Satyavani Muthu, Parithi Elamvazhuthi and Chengai Sivam to the Assembly.
RK NAGAR
The cliched ‘last, but not the least’ usage would be apt to describe RK Nagar, a constituency which is in the news since 2015, when J Jayalalithaa decided to contest from here. The AIADMK supremo, who lost her Sri Rangam MLA and Chief Minister posts after she was convicted by a Bengaluru court in disproportionate assets case, chose to contest from RK Nagar after she was acquitted by another court. And the rest, as they say, is history (cliched again).
The end of last year saw newspapers and TV Channels carrying the word RK Nagar as a permanent feature, after an action-filled by-election which saw Dhinakaran emerging triumphant."

Speaking at the Homepreneur Awards 2018 here in the city on Sunday, he said,”Which ever party you choose to join will only be benefited by your presence.”
Kamal highlighted that Tamilnadu was full of success stories about women taking up initiatives and emerging as winners.
Stating that he wanted more women to make their presence felt in the political sphere, he stressed the need for them to make their voice heard, at least by voting in the elections in large numbers.
Later he conferred awards in the view of celebrating the achievement of women who have found success with home-based businesses.
The event ‘Suyasakthi Virudhugal’ or Homepreneur Awards 2018, organised by Brand Avatar in association with Naturals Salon and Spa, felicitated 35 women achievers.
Among the awardees in diverse categories, which included education, home retail, media, food, healthcare and entertainment, Podhumponnu, a homepreneur who has been imparting skill-based training to persons with disabilities, received huge applause."
"2 books on how Karunanidhi used Tamil, cinema for politics",https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/09/karunanidhi-dravidian-politics-through-tamil-cinemas/,"August 9, 2018",PTI,Politics,"New Delhi: M Karunanidhi used the medium of films and his command over Tamil language to reach out to the people and promote the Dravidian ideology, according to two books related to the late DMK patriarch.
“Tamil was his ‘uyir moochu‘ (life breath) in more ways than one. It dominated his politics and his political career. Over time, as the first-generation leaders of the Dravidian movement passed away, Karunanidhi attempted to take over the mantle of ‘protector’ of Tamils worldwide,” the book ‘Karunanidhi: A Life in Politics‘ by journalist Sandhya Ravishankar says.
Karunanidhi discovered early that his gift was language. Wit, clarity of thought and a firm grasp over Tamil history dominated his writing – whether as editor of ‘Maanava Nesan’ (Friend of Students), a handwritten newsletter started by him during those days in school, or as the founder of DMK organ ‘Murasoli’ (Drum Roll), or as contributor to ‘Dravida Naadu’ (Dravidian Land), a magazine started by DMK founder C N Annadurai.
The other book, ‘The Dravidian Years: Politics and Welfare in Tamil Nadu’, by S Narayan, who was the economic adviser to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the writer talks about the phenomenal reach of Karunanidhi through media and films.
The people of Tamilnadu have always been avid cinema fans. Up to the 1980s, ‘touring theatres,’ basically thatched sheds with a screen, used to be the hallmark of all small towns.
The DMK transformed the medium of films into a platform for reaching out to the Tamil people about their Tamil and Dravidian identities. Karunanidhi wrote the screenplay of over 70 films, including hits such as ‘Parasakthi’, ‘Manthiri Kumari’, ‘Malaikallan’ and ‘Manohara’.
“The frequency of people going to the cinema in Tamil Nadu has been very high, and Annadurai and Karunanidhi used films as major propaganda vehicle for promoting Dravidian ideology,” Narayan writes in the book, published by Oxford.
Karunanidhi’s love for the written word perhaps stemmed from the nature of the Dravidian movement itself. Karunanidhi began his autobiography in 1975. Called ‘Nenjukku Needhi’ (Justice for the Heart), its five volumes cover in great detail his life and experiences until 2002.
Even during his stints in-between this period as chief minister, Karunanidhi continued to write. In the late 1930s, when there was a move to make the learning of Hindi in schools compulsory, there was furore among the intelligentsia of Tamilnadu.
By 1938, at the age of 14, Karunanidhi had cobbled together a band of boys as well as a cyclerickshaw. “This ragged gang roamed the streets of Tiruvarur with the Tamil Thaai (Tamil Mother) flag perched on a pole atop the vehicle. A picture of Rajaji stabbing the Tamil Thaai with the dagger of compulsory Hindi was soon added to it. Karunanidhi composed little ditties that his gang shouted as they went along,” says the book ‘Karunanidhi: A Life in Politics‘, published by HarperCollins India.
When he was 15 years old, Karunanidhi first put his writing skills on display. He founded the fortnightly magazine for students called ‘Manava Nesan’. The manuscripts were handwritten, and 50 copies were made by hand and distributed by him and his friends."
Curtains down on personality-driven bi-polar politics in TN?,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/08/curtains-down-on-personality-driven-bi-polar-politics-in-tn/,"August 8, 2018",PTI,Politics,"Chennai: The passing away of Dravidian stalwart Muthuvel Karunanidhi has signalled the virtual end of personality-driven bi-polar politics in the state, dominated by charismatic individuals of arch-rivals DMK and AIADMK in the past five decades.
While it was Karunanidhi and MGR (M G Ramachandran) who held sway over the masses in the initial phase, later it was the DMK veteran and MGR’s protege late J Jayalalithaa.
Incidentally, the year 2016 saw both Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi recede from limelight as she died after 75 days of hospitalisation in December, while the DMK chief suffered illness from which he never recovered fully till his demise.
Karunanidhi, known for his trademark baritone, lost his voice owing to a tracheosteomy procedure, and he subsequently faded away from active politics with his public appearances becoming rare till his death aged 94 last evening.
The illness forced the ever accessible nonagenarian leader to confine himself to his Gopalapuram residence as his son M K Stalin took charge of the day-to-day affairs of the party, assuming a new post of Working President.
Following his ascent to the Chief Minister’s chair for the first time in 1969 following the death of incumbent and DMK founder C N Annadurai, Karunanidhi enjoyed unbridled success till 1972 when the charismatic Ramachandran decided to play spoilsport.
Kicked out of DMK following his differences with Karunanidhi, Ramachandran, popularly known as MGR, floated AIADMK and in the 1977 general elections steered his party to a massive win against DMK. Since then, the state politics was dominated by the two individuals till MGR’s death in 1987 and the trend of bi-polar politics continued for next four decades with Jayalalithaa emerging as the new rival to Karunanidhi.
Though the AIADMK split post-MGR’s demise, Jayalalithaa unified the two factions to take forward his legacy. Observers of Tamil Nadu politics are of the view that Karunanidhi may have suffered reversals in electoral terms on many occasions, but was never down. In the political spectrum dominated by Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, leaders like Vijayakant of DMDK made some noise making impressive electoral shows.
However, their short-lived glory proved time and again that the bi-polar nature of Dravidian politics was intact. The exit of Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa from the scene, however, seems to have created a political vaccum in the state politics.
Observers are of the view that it would be a challenge for any leader to match their charisma and political influence and hence the personality-driven politics of the state could come to an end."
End of an era in national politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/08/end-of-an-era-in-national-politics/,"August 8, 2018",NT Bureau,Politics,"Chennai: The death of grand old man of Indian politics and DMK Patriarch M Karunanidhi, marked the end of an era, not only in Tamilnadu politics, but also in National politics.
A giant pillar of the Dravidian movement in Tamilnadu lay shattered in the passing away of five time chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi who had steered the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) through several trials and tribulations and had etched a formidable script in the
modern history of the State.
Born as Dakshinamoorthy on 3 June, 1924 in Thirukkuvalai village in Nagapattinam district to Muthuvelu and Anjugam, Mr Karunanidhi was
affectionately called ‘Kalaignar’, a sobriquet given to him by late actor M R Radha after being overawed by his literary and skills, by
one and all.
He was a multi-faceted personality with a high degree of eloquence in tamil literary field and had contributed significantly to the Tamil film world and also to the amateur theatre in his early days.
A master strategist, tactician and shrewd politician, Karunanidhi had held the reigns of the party very strongly with the sway of words and charismatic personality that attracted people to him like a magnet.
Though he was seen as anti-congress during the anti-Hindi agitation and during the dark days of emergency in 1975, he later stitched an alliance with the Congress during the tenure of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and was architect in establishing a non-congress regime headed by H D Devegowda under the banner of United Front after being part of the National Front government headed by I K Gujral.
Though the DMK used to term the BJP as communal, it had entered into an alliance with the saffron party during A B Vajapyee government in 1999 after the AIADMK led by Ms J Jayalalithaa withdrew support within 13 months of forming the government in 1998.
Later, he severed ties with the BJP and again entered into an alliance with the Congress in 2004 and secured a landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections. The alliance continued in 2009, before the DMk went alone in 2014 Lok Sabha polls and drew a blank.
As a seasoned statesman, Kalaignar has been guiding spirit in providing valuable contributions in national politics when the country has been witnessing coalition governance since 1990.
As a strong proponent of vibrant federalism, he rendered his constant support to the formation of governments at the national level and was seen as one of the architects of the successful coalition governments and the new era political federalism in India.

Letter politics: Siddaramaiah sends one more missive to Kumaraswamy,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/07/letter-politics-siddaramaiah-sends-one-more-missive-to-kumaraswamy/,"August 7, 2018",PTI,Politics,"Bengaluru: Continuing with his letter writing spree, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has shot off another missive to Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, asking him to reconsider shifting the film city from Mysuru to Ramanagara.
Siddaramaiah, who is the Chairman of the Congress-JD(S) coalition coordination committee, has so far written four letters to Kumaraswamy on a host of issues, including the one to reconsider the budget announcement to increase fuel prices.
In the letter, he asked the Chief Minister to reconsider the budget announcement to shift the film city to Ramanagara, Kumaraswamy’s assembly segment, and take steps to set it up in Mysuru, Siddaramaiah’s home district.
Pointing out that it has been the dream and demand of the Kannada film industry for a film city to be set up in Mysuru, the CLP leader described the ‘palacecity‘ as the most sought after destination by film producers not only from Kannada, but also from the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu film industries.
Since 1945,film shooting had been taking place in Mysuru, he noted as he recalled contributions of studios like ‘Navajyoti‘ and ‘Premier’, which produced talented actors and technicians.
“Kannada thespian late Dr Rajkumar had dreamed aboutthe film city in Mysuru, realising which the previous Congress government decided to set up a film city in the city and approved hundred acres of land for this purpose.
“An officialannouncement was also made in the budget,” Siddaramaiah said in his letter dated 31 July.
“But you have announced in the budget to shift the film city to Ramanagara. Considering all these factors, I request you to reconsider this decision and take necessary steps to set up the film city in Mysuru,” he added.
Siddaramaiah’s letters are seen as an attempt by him to prove his hold over the coalition government. In what is described as “letter politics”,JD(S) chief H D Deve Gowda used to write letters to the then Congress-JD(S) coalition government headed by Congress’ Dharm Singh with Siddaramaiah as Deputy Chief Minister.
Siddaramaiah’s letter to the Chief Minister has come despite the reported suggestion of newly appointed Pradesh Congress Chief Dinesh Gundu Rao to him to talk about the issues incoordination committee meetings, rather than writing letters.
Meanwhile, not wishing to comment, Water Resources minister D K Shivakumar said, “what had to be passed in the budget has been passed.it is out of my department to comment.”
When it was pointed out he was Ramanagara district in-chargeminister, he said “I’m Minister for the entire state…. I don’t want to comment or talk about it.”

“Dhinakaran met his aunt at the jail in the afternoon. He spent 45 minutes with Sasikala and discussed political developments in Tamilnadu,” Dhinakaran loyalist Pugazhendi told PTI.
Dhinakaran, who was accompanied by Pugazhendi and other associates, visited the jail at 12.15 pm and came out at 1 pm.
Sasikala has been been in jail since February last year after being imprisoned in the disproportionate assets case.
Speaking to reporters outside the jail premises, Dhinakaran said his party has not yet decided on alliance for the coming 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
“We have not decided on which side my party would be. In 2014, DMK allied with Congress and other parties went with some other alliance, but Amma (former Tamilnadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa) stood alone. I am also like her, but I am not against any alliance,” he said.
He was responding to a query on joining hands with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to prevent the BJP from coming back to power in 2019. Dhinakaran said his party would not join any alliance where DMK is there.
“If Congress wants our support, let them come out of the alliance with DMK,” he added."

“BJP wants Assamese Identity to be intact at the cost of sacrificing Identity of 40 lakh people but in Kashmir BJP wants Article 35 to be scrapped to dilute Kashmiri Identity? BJP is playing politics of Convenience & Identity where it suits them politically but Sctt is monitoring,” he said on a social networking site.
Owaisi was referring to Article 35 A of the Constitution which empowers the Jammu and Kashmir legislature to define the State’s ‘permanent residents’ and their special rights and privileges.

‘Power of Attorney’ politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2017/02/17/power-of-attorney-politics-2/,"February 17, 2017",Jawahar T R,Politics,"Rational TN can stump lawmen and laymen alike. The happenings here have always been high on absurd theatrics and can easily carry away and confound even the sanest of minds in an emotional sweep. The current scenario is just old wine adulterated by a Midas touch, in fresh disposable plastic crush cups.
Whenever some kind of real or reel show hits the public space suddenly, the optics spike in a jiffy and the din touches such a crescendo that the normal vision is blurred by the haze of hype and our ear drums are thumped and torn beyond tolerance. A frustrated, fatigued populace has no choice but to fall back on its familiar ‘last resorts’, namely social media memes and Vadivelu capers. Thick skin and lighter veins are our insurance against the ceaseless antics.
This past week I have realised the futility of writing on TN politics. Everytime I put and proceed with the finger on the keyboard, it is the ‘backspace’ button that beckons most. Ditto now too. By the time you read this, if indeed you do, bless such souls, the words and thoughts would have been trampled upon by a thousand new ‘developments’ and a million more WhatsApp caricatures, verbal and visual.
So, at the time of going to press, the new CM is Edappadi Palanisamy, EPS, and we will know his status officially only after this issue comes out of press. In just five days, we have had three CM prospects; stop-gap OPS, who had to make way in a huff. The Udan Pirava Sahodhari, UPS, whose power connection was snapped by the SC and her lackey, EPS, all set to blare as His Madam’s Voice, in her stead. And if by some act of God, he fails to make a clean sweep of the floor of the Assembly, the ball will be back in OPS court to prove his claim.
There are some sore points that beg our attention. The MLAs’ prolonged confinement in a luxury resort is actually the most telling proof of undue influence, of all kinds if reports of merry-making are to be believed. There is no clue till the floor test of the numbers in so-called willing captivity. UPS and EPS have consistently said in public that the legislators will be let out only if there is a call by the Governor to form the Government. Indeed, when the hosts themselves issue such blatant ultimatums, it is a classic kidnap-blackmail- hostage scenario.
Is that not reason enough to question their claim and demand release of MLAs first before inviting EPS? There is much debate about the legal obligations of the Governor. The Constitution is no substitute for common wisdom. On the contrary there are many provisions that expressly demand of the titular heads to exercise their discretion or satisfy themselves in these kinds of situations. No court can pressurise a Governor to act within a particular timeframe. It is my considered personal opinion that, having waited for Sasi & Co to get convicted, a stern order to free the MLAs was the most logical step, even if Govt formation were to take some more time. The Constitution and this cursed State would not be any poorer. The dreadful prospect of UPS and then EPS had infused popular psyche with infinite patience. But alas!
Also, OPS had no opportunity to even talk to the MLAs. The MLAs themselves never had the chance to talk to their partymen or to know the mind of their constituency. In a democracy, a legislator’s free will has to emanate and evolve from the will of those whom he/she represents and in our party system, also those who worked for him/her. This never happened, probably out of fear or for some extraneous favours, that need no guesswork. If the MLAs themselves waived this right which is really a duty, they are guilty of a graver crime; failing the people who voted them. We all knew who the people preferred, or at least, who the people did not certainly want. That elected reps feel beholden to those who gave them ticket or whatever else instead of to those who empowered them, is a terrible travesty.
Democracy has thrown up a perverse arithmetic by which the extracted will of around 120-odd characters sans, er, ditto, is all set to negate the visible, spontaneous, collective will of about 8 cr hapless people. Indeed every vote has been vetoed and vitiated. The AIADMK cadre know not how to deal with Chinnamma’s choice when Amma’s perennial preferred person has been put away unceremoniously. For the black mark on our index finger on poll day, we have had too many black days.
So, unless J’s ghost miraculously makes an appearance in her MLAs’ consciences which are now on a holiday, let’s all gear up for a new TN, TTV TN! And from Jungle Raj to Jail Raj. Rationalism has brought us a long way, surely!"
Mixing politics and religion,https://newstodaynet.com/2012/10/06/mixing-politics-and-religion/,"October 6, 2012",Jawahar T R,Politics,"So, the party is out of the bag. But are not a name and description essential for the launch of something to be called a real launch? Well, Arvind Kejrival has declared that the name, constitution and office bearers will all be announced on Nov 26 which happens to be the day the Indian Constitution was adopted. So, the trial launch of the yet-to-be-named outfit on Gandhi Jayanthi was a formality, just to invoke the father of the nation. Such symbolisms like the ill-fitting Gandhi caps (I doubt if Gandhi ever wore one consistently) and sanguine speeches all seemed suspiciously familiar.
Still, the nameless new born deserves a chance if only to keep the political kettle of scum and scams at boiling point in public memory. The key feature of India’s polity of the last two years is the quiet appropriation of political antagonism by the activists. The prime reason is the justifiable distrust of the whole political system and those infesting it for too long. Having tasted power and pelf, politicos of all hues simply cannot be expected to take up and talk of core issues affecting peope with complete conviction and concern. The freshers can address this fatigue provided they walk around in their normal attire and hairdos and refrain from rhetoric.
Winning, of course, is a different ball game. The electoral system is heavily loaded in favour of existing political parties. The new arrival, we will call it X Party till Nov 26, will have to reckon with money, muscle and media, all of which can jointly and severally queer the pitch. It is an unequal battle vis-a-vis the first two. But a frugal and non-violent volunteer force, in an otherwise vulgarly expensive and voluble election campaign scenario, is bound to stand out, more so in this tech driven age wherein info about a good candidate can be spread in a jiffy. The media, given their nature, is an unreliable ally, despite Kejiriwal’s well-meaning overtures to them at the launch. He can check that out with Anna— if they are still on talking terms!
The main plus of X party is the absence of any political baggage. Those behind it have been in public glare only for some time now.They do not also seem to have a personal axe to grind, but one never knows. At best they can be accused of naivette and knee-jerk idealism. That the activists have made bold to take the plunge to purge the system from the inside is itself laudable. They have done this despite the overwhelming skepticism of their own mentor and mates. Nor have the criminal proclivities of their main bete noir, the Cong, become a deterrent.
In my view, the leader-driven party system is the bane of our politics. But then, can a grouping of equals offer any meaningful solution and earn public confidence? Indeed, the vertical split in the anti-corruption movement is itself proof that well-meaning and intelligent people are unlikely to agree on anything. Add egos and friction on non-common denominators plus the mischief of the wily, watchful political hounds and is it not likely that the X Party runs the risk of being rendered an ex-Party soon? We can only hope that the new outfit and its inevitable clones will side-step the minefields of a monolithic High Command-centric institution and personality clashes and field credible, committed candidates sensitive to people’s present frustrations. Aravind & Co must also cede constituencies to good candidates who may not want to contest under their banner. That will be a good test of their stated intentions. Of course, the voters will face a bigger test for they would have lesser excuses to crib over bad alternatives.
—————————————-
Now, let me quit dreaming and get to the earthier realm of religion. My unfaithful indulgence last week has touched some raw nerves and also elicited ‘welcome to the club’ calls from atheists. The point is anything in excess is poison, more so religion because it is contagious and people crave it. Some feel I have fallen between the spiritual and scientific stools. But the Truth is beyond and not between the two. And at the time of going to press, it remains out of reach of the experiences of a spiritualist and the experiments of a scientist alike. By Truth is meant the origin or source of all, be it God or God particle, no bother.
But while scientists display some humility in keeping the spiritual option open, religious heads and their followers are steadfast in their ignorant and arrogant claim that only they, their faith and their messiah are privy to the sacred secret. The smart God apparently gave man only his image, not his intellect. Reason why the so-called proofs of religionists are spoofs on common sense. To which they argue that one should transcend reason and rely only on revelation in order to reach God. Now, is it not odd that God should demand suspension of the very senses that are necessary to track him/her/it? Surely, would not a faith based on reason be on a firmer footing? But thanks to organised religion and its mobocracy, an individual is so genetically blinded and culturally conditioned as to shun even such thoughts as blasphemous or at least, inauspicious.
Tools (such as rituals and symbols) are not the end product. Forget anti-God atheists. Even the believers should be ready for a kind of spiritual iconoclasm that bulldozes the self-imposed religious stonewalls when necessary and enables them to look beyond. And that’s only the beginning …!

The poison called politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2011/10/16/the-poison-called-politics/,"October 16, 2011",Jawahar T R,Politics,"The term ‘politics’ originally referred to the ‘art or science of governance’. Politics being a public matter was to be insulated from isolated individuals and instead stress on groups and consensus. But since it still rested on fallible, fragile and fickle humans, politics gradually became less related to governance and more about managing and manoeuvring. It is today the art of the possible wherein anything goes and ends make even foul means sacred.
That, along with the prospect of unlimited power and abundant profit for the practitioners, is quite a dicey invitation to the unscrupulous. With punditry and probity having been expelled from public life, politics is now a great leveller, putting a profound ideologue on par with a petty idiot or a sundry scoundrel seeming no different from a self-styled honest man. For, on the political scale they are all the same self-seeking, stuffed, small men, out to make hay while the sun shines. Indeed, politics today is synonymous with the politician with not a shred of the original loftiness left. Of course, one can invent a new word to define the art of governance, but trust the political tribe to sully that too as any deed is only as good as the doer. In any case, the problem is not one of semantics. It is about sanity!
The pervasive presence as also the paralysing effects of this parasite called politics is on parade all over India. The art of the possible and its practitioners have together made life impossible for everyone. Even a few decades back, there were many areas of national life that remained untouched by politics or a politician. Not anymore. Not a sector in the country and not a cell in our self has escaped the evil eye of the vile politico! They are no longer content with bribes; they want to take over our businesses and livelihoods. All they survey is theirs. They straddle our psyche and surroundings like a dark shadow. But worse is the contrast in interests of what should actually be a reciprocal relationship. The guardians have turned tormentors. Our increasing dependence on them has instead made them more indifferent and insensitive. All our crises are opportunities for them. Yes, we do have the vote; but they still own the vote banks!
The disastrous disconnect is total. People’s problems and politicians’ priorities are completely at cross-purposes. Nothing amplifies this pathetic picture than the present. Take the evergreen corruption issue. As suspected by some and expected by most, the rulers have no intention of bringing any Lokpal Bill in the winter session of Parli, a promise that was clearly vague even when it was made. Since the Cong intent is to upstage the activists and not uproot corruption, and in the process buy time till the Swiss billions are buried elsewhere, the party has suddenly floated the idea of a separate Constitutional authority, like the Election Commission, and credited the same to Rahul’s bright brain. The party might even christen it Rahul Commission against Corruption, incidentally an apt contradiction in terms. So, as the party and the pretender walk away with having ‘eradicated’ corruption thus, the people wonder why these champions themselves are still not in jail! And also guessing if the anti-corruption outfit itself would need greasing to move!
Every child born today is sensitised to corruption even before the umbilical cord is cut. Really, the culture of bribery is genetically transmitted so that immunity is inbuilt. A modern Indian already asks ‘how much’ rather than screaming ‘what’ when asked to pay on the sly. Any indignation is only about the ruling rates. Such being the levels of awareness and conditioning, it is strange why BJP’s LKA has embarked on his familiar yatra to familiarise the people on the very familiar corruption prevailing all over India. Clearly, this outdated BJP veteran, who has more decades to look back than forward, seems certain that in the current milieu corruption is the right rath that will take him to where his sights are actually set: Capital. And just as the Ram rath helped coronate LKA in Delhi, even as Rama himself remained exiled from Ayodhya, trust corruption to fall on the roadside once the rider reaches the destination. And to think that this yatra politics is not just against the rulers but also to ride roughshod over some of his own ambitious colleagues makes it even more sickening. But, pray, if yatras can put paid to bribery why is it still thriving when millions of yatris are always crisscrossing the country at any time?
But politics over corruption is as endemic and enduring as corruption itself. Look at the other flares alight all over the nation. Telangana, for one, is a direct offshoot of Cong politics, ably aided by regional charlatans out to exploit poverty and isolation. Here too the people themselves are the least and the last in the loop as the various interest groups, mostly elite prime time pundits, carve out Andhra Pradesh according to their whims as if it were a cake on the plate. The political games have been played for too long and the fair winds seem to have passed. All sides have now climbed high walls and pushed away the ladders. Trust the T-issue to be truly tectonic. But with coal stocks stuck and the prospect of movement through the middle of India becoming impossible, a national power breakdown looks imminent. The politics over Koodankulam is another case in point. The flip-flops of the various political parties would put kollywood stuntmen to shame. After twenty years and several millions of public money, this nuclear power plant is yet to light a single bulb. And now all this. We know power corrupts politicos. But here politics is corrupting power.
So, granted, politics has despoiled all good things of life. And this poison is stuck in our throats. But politics has also not spared scams and scamsters. Gone are the days when a single party like Cong could get away as the sole looter. A very dharmic coalition politics has ensured that scams are democratised and dispersed. Talk of checks and balances in the system. Of course, that also explains why Rs 64 crs zoomed to Rs 1.76 lakh crs, give or take a few thousands, in just twenty-five years. More mouths to feed and even more to keep shut!

The politics of art,https://newstodaynet.com/2010/03/07/the-politics-of-art/,"March 7, 2010",Jawahar T R,Politics,"‘I a m a bit confused here. How does one deal with offensive art? But then is it art at all if it is offensive? And who is the arbiter when what is offensive to one set of eyes seems a creative masterpiece to another? Does artistic freedom come with an uninhibited right to offend? And how should the offended lot react? These questions are valid not just for art but for any form of expression, creative or crass. The discussion too can range from the profound to the pedestrian. And sadly, the debate often yields either or both of the two results, namely, vandalism and more offensive art, neither of which helps the cause (?) of art! Of course, the confusing questions will remain.
To my mind, art appreciation is a personal matter and is therefore, highly subjective. Even when there is a seeming consensus on the artistic worth of a piece, it would turn out that people agree for different reasons. I might have fallen for Mona Lisa’s dreamy eyes and you, to her elevated forehead. ‘Connoisseurs’ might see something you, I and even M Lisa would have missed while there could be a chosen lot who may see virtues vis-à-vis something not on the canvas at all. Many Renaissance paintings are valued for what they should have depicted but failed to, for that was the artists’ way of protest against the religious oppression of their times!
As a statutory declaration, I plead total ignorance of the finer nuances of paintings. In that I am in the company of a great part of humanity for whom an apparent thing of beauty is a joy for now and ever, unmindful of its deeper meanings. For us art is purely a matter for the eyes and may touch our heart momentarily, but we do not take it to our heart and wage a prolonged quarrel over it. If an art breaches the senses and seeks to attack your sensibility, you dismiss it is as no art at all and move to the next stall to see if anything there makes sense to you. In short, a work of art can either be appreciated or ignored, but is not worth fighting for. Art by its very nature as an expression of some individual’s soul cannot be a seed for social conflict. In that, not just the creator but the beholder too should be careful it remains that way.
So how do we explain all the hullabaloo over paintings? Two factors come into play to make the simple canvas a bloody playground: Elitism and Politics! For the bulk of the people who just see eye to eye with art and nothing more, there is no cause for grouse even if the artwork offends their feelings. They just move on. In fact there are far more unpalatable stuff doing the rounds in the common man’s domain that can actually cause national upheavals but this mass art goes unnoticed by the media as it has no big name behind it nor any big-time editor writing exclusives. It is only the elitist art crowd, a closed cocoon, that actually kicks up all the controversies and also gets the media sponsors, grossly disproportionate to the size of their audience as well as the quality of their art. This art circuit is a narrow band to which entry is restricted: high-profile buyers, pampered artists and well-connected, suave exhibitionists are part of this loop. Here art is big business wherein the price tag draws more viewers than the art itself and purse-strings, not the brush strokes, count for more. And controversies only enhance the stakes. I for one have found many Rs 50 paintings on the sidewalk far superior to many of the stuff peddled in five-star exhibitions for huge sums. But it is the latter that hog the limelight thanks to heavyweight backers.
The picture turns murkier when the canvas gets political hues. The likes of MF Hussain know this well as do those who hound him and it is difficult to find legitimacy in either. I claim no sophistication to judge what little of MFH’s paintings I have seen. But what I can say with certainty is that this man is a habitual mischief monger. The nude goddesses of the Hindu pantheon that he depicts reveal no artistic spontaneity but a pre-meditated, burning itch to provoke trouble. Many want to know if this ungodly painter would give the same treatment to gods of other faiths. May be now that he is securely settled in Qatar, a ‘haven of free expression’, he would let his roving naked eye wander freely across the entire religious spectrum. And if he survives, he may also want to get citizenship for some of his eminent Indian friends, which will be a good idea for them and good riddance for our country as such. Incidentally, has India stripped MFH … of his citizenship, now that he has declared himself alien?
But how much can a tiny Qatar take? Not that Q will take everybody in, for, not everyone can say ‘My name is Husain’. Still, if the moral police here have their way, not just the likes of MFH’s or Khushboos, but also a good part of the country should be banished to wherever for breaking many taboos. Really, the exiled painter’s strip and tease act would have gone largely unnoticed but for these self-styled vigilantes of virtues putting it on the public pedestal. If MFH blasphemed their goddesses these champions have outraged their own religious modesty even more in every court across Bharath. A forgettable slight is sought to be stuck in our memory for posterity! Or look at those Islamic fundamentalists who have in the last few days converted Shimoga and parts of Karnataka into inaccessible islands on land. Are they advancing their cause even a bit by vandalising the offices of the newspapers that carried translations of articles of Taslima Nasreen, an irritation of an insider, no doubt! Aah, we know this is exactly what these vandals wanted!
For many of us caught in the crossfire these are deadly dilemmas. Many works of art do offend, either in their shoddiness or owing to shady motives. The best option, we feel, is to ignore them so they die a natural death. But harping on them actually increases the hurt and worse elevates pathetic pieces to pompous heights. And more apalling is the intellectual discourse in cases like MFH’s. The man’s flight to Gulf is a blot on our secularism and has sent freedom of expression for a toss, we are told. With MFH as its latest icon, secularism actually looks like his painting — bare! At another extreme are the white-dove pacifists who proclaim that art promotes peace and MFH’s exit is a blow to that project! Peace of mind maybe if the picture is pleasant, but peace? We thought, less nude drawings in circulation owing to MFH’s absence would actually bring more peace. Anyway, we have this to say to those peaceniks: Adolf Hitler was a prolific artist who however ended up painting the whole world red!

All is fair in love and politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2008/02/17/all-is-fair-in-love-and-politics/,"February 17, 2008",Jawahar T R,Politics,"Roman emperor Claudius, who believed that married men made for bad soldiers, passed a law prohibiting the youth of his land from entering wedlock. And enter, St Valentine; the priest presto went on a marriage spree, arranging clandestine weddings for love-lorn couples. He was arrested soon enough and put to death, but he lives on as a martyr for romance. The hand-drawn pictures of the bearded bloke, however, look anything but romantic, but he probably had a heart that melted at the sight of jilted lovers. Sure, there are a variety of Valentines in history and various versions too, but the aforesaid V and his ‘invaluable service’ to the cause of humanity, looks the most handy, not just for those bitten by that dangerous bug but also to the legions of marketeers purveying and pushing products ranging from jewels, cards, bouquets to bands! Wonder how St V missed being a mascot for Viagra!
Having thus bestowed all that borrowed enlightenment on self and society, the question lingers: What has politics got to do with such finer things as romance? Well, as Perry Mason would have put it, I hope to connect it all up, hon. readers! But you will have to wait for para 3 for that. For I am not as yet done with the subject of V — Valentine, not Viagra — and para 2 is still very young. Now, cut to the present. Love is in the air virtually, thanks to all those FM channels and Satellite TV whose endless entreaties ensures that not a soul passes Feb 14 without at least a wink; and let me assure you, those DJs and VJs are hugely successful in their holy venture of parading and promoting promiscuity. The print media for its part delights in providing sensuous tips that can trip even saints (ie., other than St V, who already knew all the tricks). And then there are the endearments via SMS from mobile phone companies and sundry other samaritans that have all made Valentine’s worldview so commonplace that the exalted ‘I love you’ would soon replace the everyday ‘Good Morning’ or ‘Nice weather’ or even ‘Hello’ as the opening line in any conversation.
Indeed, be an individual single or coupled, life has been made to look downright worthless if one is not in love, with a consort or any sort, for that matter, at least for a few hours. In fact, you may even get sponsors who will bring to you that part of love, besides a gift hamper; you can then take home … the gift, leaving your love behind, but you would have served the memory of St V, which is most vital in these trying times.The euphoria is all-inclusive; many parents of teenagers who used to be aghast at their wards being lured by the stupid Cupid, are themselves hooked now. Smart marketing whizkids have created V-packages for all ages and sizes, marital-status being no bar. And surprisingly, the usually viscious anti-Valentine vigilantes too have toned down their volume! Busy probably bashing up north Indians or worse, sending flowers, having themselves been overwhelmed by the pressure of passion. If so, should not the Raj Thackerays be promoting the desi version, who, with his ubiquitous flower-decked bow and arrow had toiled longer than St V to network separated souls?
See the connection? Ha, love has led to politics, as I promised, and we are, as you would have realised, come to Para 3, though P 2 had gobbled all of a column and more. Now, romance may be the flavour of the week all around, but in politics, particularly in rational TN, estrangement looks to be the order. Much married political partners are straying apart and even strange bedfellows are lying back to back, but without exactly alighting. Come polltime, the mating season would commence in right earnest, but for now the filial bickerings are at a peak
.
Polygamous DMK is paying the price for being wedded to one too many partners. With each one tugging and often pulling at the delicate alliance chords, the ruling party is truly at the end of its tether. With its prime ally Congress unwilling to shed its suspicions over the DMK’s tiger-riding pastime of the past, K is truly hardpressed to prove his fidelity. Again, the Left, notwithstanding its own sordid track record in Nandigram, nonchalantly rakes up the deteriorating L&O situation in the State, but the usually quick-witted K takes it all lying down. But the Kaikeyi of the plot is doubtless Ramadoss. K- Karunanidhi, not Kaikeyi, that is – must be ruefully recalling his mentor Anna’s famous dialogue in a movie: A chaste wife will even murder! Now, the PMK by no means is politically chaste, but that’s unlikely to stop the maruththuvar from seeking divorce as well as drawing blood. Poor K has little choice but to seek solace in preview theatres and felicitation fetes!
AIADMK’s J or rather, J’s AIADMK is currently a loner, if one ignores Vaiko. Some traditions dub the V-Day as ‘Singles Awareness Day’ and the AIADMK is doubtless conscious of its own political isolation. The DMK’s adulterous allies may be quarreling with their common spouse, but they sure are in no mood to elope with the AIADMK, having become wiser through painful past marriages. J, in sheer desperation, did float a third front six months back, promising to keep both the Cong and BJP at arm’s length. Political pundits predicted that the doomed third front would collapse soon. They were wrong. It collapsed very soon. The partners of the mass marriage went their own ways after posing for press photographers. The BJP which was supposed to be at arm’s length, is now itching for an embrace, despite being fatally hen-pecked in 1999. That may be in keeping with the spirit of Saint V, for political love is never lost, but what of the spirit of the saints of Kanchiwhich was violated in the most venal and vindictive manner?
And then there are the two eligible political bachelors, V.Kanth and S.Kumar. After having beaten around the bushes and bamboo trees with bewitching belles on screen, the two are now busy romancing the voters. The Captain, particularly, has remained steadfast on his political celibacy, but the lure of Lady Power, the most sought after Valentine of all politicos, can test anyone’s will. Whither, V.Kanth?
Moral of the story: There are better ways to celebrate V-Day than having a cynical columnist politicising it all!

"Politics, power play & primetime",https://newstodaynet.com/2006/10/29/politics-power-play-primetime/,"October 29, 2006",Jawahar T R,Politics,"While Indian cricket over-flows with politics, politicians barring Sharad Pawar, hardly have time for cricket. Unless there is an Indo-Pak series in the offing, whence cricket becomes a diplomatic, or rather, an undiplomatic affair. Today’s primetime television rarely lets our politicos sleep, let alone think of cricket, thrusting a mike into their face even before they could reach out for their toothbrush, early in the morning. So, we, at ‘Empty TV’, decided to mix cricket and politics and despatched our reporters to seek out the politicos for their comments on the ongoing ICC Champions trophy, wherein India …well, failed to become champions by losing to the Aussies, well in advance. Over to the sound-bytes of our politicos. Hoping our once-bitten-never shy viewers emerge wiser on cricket and politics or either or neither:
Dr Manmohan Singh, PM, blamed the Aussies for unleashing violence on the ground and infiltrating the boundaries too often, something the Indians rarely did and that too only under extreme provocation. He praised the Indians for exercising restraint by not hitting too hard or bowling too fast and added that henceforth India-Australia matches should be resolved through talks in the pavilion itself. FM Chidambaram reasoned that India’s deficit and Australia’s surplus were the prime causes and warned that if the deficit-run continues, India will continue to be economical with victories also.
Sources close to 10 Janpath claimed that Soniaji never listened to cricket commentary, or for that matter anything other than her inner voice. So our reporter, in line with the Capital’s journalistic norms, approached her a bit cautiously and with extreme indulgence, lest the sensitive signora sulks, scoots or sacrifices. To our persistent queries at her doorstep, the Silent Saint just smiled repeatedly and all were truly smitten by her eloquence. After all, what are a thousand words worth before that all-knowing smile? Anyway the Congress leaders and cadre who were waiting at the gates for the last two days, seemed to have understood, as they burst into cheers. Sonia, pardon, Soniaji, waved and then she was gone. But the Congmen stayed put, the cheers continued and could be heard till we returned to the Studios a few miles away. Since then, we have been running the tapes with the blank audio; we will let in the viewers on Soniaji’s views once we decipher them.
The BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley blamed the ISI for the debacle. When asked to elaborate, he said it was India’s Suicidal Instinct which caused the defeat and said people of foreign origin should no longer be allowed to play with India. Shiv Sena chief ‘Ball’ Thackeray said so long as India did not lose to Pakistan, it does not matter who they lose to. Railway minister Rabri Prasad, sorry, Laloo Devi, sorry again, Laloo Prasad criticised the upper-caste Aussies for making cattle fodder of Indians. HRD minister Arjun Singh, hearing some mention of caste in his slumber, woke up with a start to announce a 90% reservation in the Indian squad for those who cannot bat or bowl. He said the playing eleven will be increased to twenty if necessary and the cricketing rules amended accordingly. Some women activists wanted one third quota, if not in the team, at least as the third umpire. Mandira Bedi is being tipped for that role.
The Politburos of the two main Left parties passed a resolution condemning Australian imperialism and praising the Indian team for upholding secularism. They announced a nation-wide strike but clarified that the all-India strike will not cover Kerala and West Bengal. Press releases from Left unions immediately claimed that the strike was already a success. In J&K, Farooq Abdullah and Ghulam Nabi Azad, former and present CMs respectively, said that instead of hanging Afzal, the Indian team members should be told to hang their boots.
The cricket-Gunya has infected TN politicians too. The State’s leaders took a break from cinema, serials and mutual mudslinging to put across their rational views, albeit only on their own channels. Your Empty TV managed to buy up some footage for undisclosed amounts, in tune with the State’s political culture. TN CM Karunanidhi arraigned the Aryan Australians for driving out the ‘Dravid’ ians from the contest. He then announced free TVs with free cable connection for the Indian players who were free now to watch the other matches. The Kalaingar also added that, in case they still had time, they were free to visit Chennai to felicitate him with an award, something like, say, Dravid Thalaivan. He offered to keep himself free for them. PMK chief Ramadoss said India, sorry, indhiya thiru naadu deserved to lose, as there was not a single Tamil player in the team. He then suggested Anbumani’s name as a possible candidate and then hit out at Karunanidhi’s family politics. He, however, added that his party was still part of the DPA family… alliance. DK chief Veeramani hailed the umpires, the men in black, for upholding the ideals of Periyar, besides their index finger often during the Indian innings.
AIADMK supremo Jayal-alithaa said the Indians lost because they did not throw themselves around on the ground much and advised them to take a lesson or two from her partymen. Blaming K’s anti-people policies for the defeat, she also wondered if the Indian team was drunk like …well, you know who. DMDK leader V’Kanth promptly ‘scotch’ed such rumours and countered that the Indian team did not curl up inside the pavilion but made it to the field. He then announced his next movie, titled Captain Krupakaran. Film industry grape ‘wine’ says the plot is about the captain of a one-man cricket team defeating a Rest of the World team, single handedly.

The politics of perverse priorities,https://newstodaynet.com/2006/05/28/the-politics-of-perverse-priorities/,"May 28, 2006",Jawahar T R,Politics,"‘Utterly Perverted Alliance’ would be a more apt description of the UPA dispensation running, or rather, ruining the nation for the last two years. That politicians cannot think beyond the next election …make it by-election …unlike statesmen whose vision spans generations has never been proven more emphatically. If what agitates them most, as revealed by their words and deeds is any indication, the Congress ministers just emerge as a bunch of Neros fiiddling away in discordant notes, either oblivious to the burning issues or as a deliberate ploy to divert attention from their impotence.
Some samples:
When the official mass gambling den, passing under the respectable nomenclature, stock market, went bust, the utterances of not just the Finance Minister but the entire monetary hierarchy of the nation merit close attention. P.Chidambaram, the suave custodian of the nation’s finances spoke thus: I have talked to the RBI governor and there is no liquidity problem. Money would be provided to those who want to answer margin calls. These ‘comforting words’ were promptly echoed down the line and followed too to the letter, leading to some recovery, albeit, till the next crash. Now the question on the layman’s lips: So what if the brokers go broke? After all, it is part of the game and in any case they were only gambling! Why should the Finance Minister go out of the way to their rescue, throwing all banking norms to the winds, when there are more pressing demands on his time and the nation’s resources? How many times has the ‘suave’ FM, let alone rising to the rescue, even offered such assurances to the debt-ridden farmers, who are committing suicide in droves all over the country? Or to the millions of citizens struggling to make two ends meet? Or to the scores of small businessmen running from pillar to post for just a hand loan to meet a commitment? Indeed, a very painful perversion of priorities by the nation’s financial benefactor!
While even a blind shot by the Pandava Arjun can hit the mark, the neo-Arjun with a quiver full of quotas can deliver a clean mis-hit even with all eyes open. The Reservation Asthra that he unleashed in all dynastic zeal, with the UP elections figuring as the not too distant target, may well miss the mark with the caste polarisations there getting a bit too stark for Congmen’s comfort. While the forward castes are likely to move their accounts from the Cong bank to the BJP’s, the BCs, OBCs, dalits and minorities are unlikely to shift their loyalties in a big way from Mayawati, Mulayam etc. Heads or Tails, Cong seems to lose, thanks to Arjun’s arrow-turned-boomerang! But politics apart, real issues like literacy for the unlettered multitudes, improving the quality of primary education, expansion of infrastructure, training of faculty etc do not even seem to figure in the scheme of things of our honourable human resource destruction minister! Aah, but Arjun Singh is no statesman, just a petty political prankster. By the way, the committee formed to find an answer to the quota quiz has come out with an ‘urgent’ investment budget of a whopping Rs8000 crores of non-recurring and Rs 2000 cr of recurring expenditure to ensure the general category does not lose out because of 27% OBC quota. What suicidal ad-hocism!
The Da Vinci code had raised the hackles of the faithful all over the Christian world. Yet, even overtly Catholic countries refrained from imposing restrictions on the movie, let alone banning it. But secular India is different. Here minority vote is a veto and minority voice, a gospel. So, little wonder, no less a person that the Information Minister, Priyaranjan Das Munshi doubled up as censor board officer, saw the movie in the company of some Christian reps, then cleared the same, Albeit with disclaimers and thus performed his secular karma. Now, one should not take the cue and petition the Minister for special shows of scores of movies that routinely criticise or caricature Indian gods. Dis-information ministers of secular India will have no ears for children of lesser gods and in any case naive Indians still believe that ministership is an exalted posting and a minister’s time most valuable! But the resourceful reverends knew better!
Really, such a queer sense of priorities in Congress psyche is not surprising. It results from the voluntary subjugation of all interests, national, party and individual, to the first family’s. The Congress has lost power in Kerala; continues to be exiled from red Bengal; was unable to clinch cabinet berths in TN; is woefully dependent on increasingly powerful allies at the Centre. Yet the Congmen are celebrating. Reason? Saint Sonia has won in Rae Bareilly!And lo, Rahul and Priyanka are coming up quite admirably! That’s all that matters to this spineless, shameless tribe. The nation’s honour, their own party’s hallowed history, the reputation of men of mettle like Manmohan and even Kalaam, the looming shadows of Volcker and Quatrochchi, rising bloodbath in Kashmir …nothing is of consequence when compared to their zeal to protect, preserve and promote Sonia, their supreme priority!
For them, anarchy in the country is a worthy price so long as the monarchy at Janpath prevails!

The pettiness & politics behind Aid,https://newstodaynet.com/2005/12/03/the-pettiness-politics-behind-aid/,"December 3, 2005",Jawahar T R,Politics,"Time. Newsweek. National Geographic. The Economist. You name any international magazine. The reigning theme in all of them over the last few weeks has been the massive humanitarian aid effort needed to give relief and to rehabilitate people affected by a spate of natural disasters during the past year, particularly the last few months.
Be it the tsunami hit-Indian Ocean nations, hurricane-hit New Orleans, quake-hit Kashmir or our own flood ravaged TN, multitudes running into millions have been killed, maimed or rendered homeless. Add to that the refugees and victims in war- ravaged or insurgency-ridden lands like Afghanistan, Iraq and Uganda. Indeed, the question of rebuilding those lives gnaws at the collective conscience of the entire world. And, to be fair, individuals and nations have risen and rallied to embark on an unprecedented relief effort gobally to alleviate the sufferings of those unfortunate people. Given the magnitude of the disasters, any effort is bound to be dwarfed or seem inadequate, but every bit does count.
But what cannot really be counted as necessary is the unseemly politics that transpires behind the aid effort. Although it is the relief workers who, forgetting their own families and woes, toil tirelessly day and night, reach out to inaccessible lands and risk limb and life to bring succour to the affected, it is invariably the politicos who are the visible faces of such efforts, because they personify the government. Of course, they get the stick too from their opponents and the media, but for them the political benefits far exceed the risks, or so they think. And so when politicians control as well as hold forth on relief, can it remain just a humanitarian affair any longer? Indeed, blame-games are played out even in the US and UN, but this rational state of Tamilnadu surely takes the cake for its unique brand of misery-politics.
TN is now in the throes of a major humanitarian crisis wrought by three spells of rain, with the fourth threatening its shores this weekend. The damage by all measures is immense and in many cases irreparable. Out of the Rs 13500 cr sought the Centre has sanctioned Rs 500 cr for now with promise of more. That surely is a pittance, but strangely seems enough for politicking to take off.
The clamour for credit which has already commenced will soon climb to a crescendo. One voice will claim, ‘I did it, I got it’. ‘No, it is our effort’ will be the prompt response. The ’me too’ chorus will join in, for there is no dearth for allies and so allied voices. Already, a few have met the PM, FM et al independently, to record their efforts, just in case, for ‘securing‘ aid that will in any case flow in!
And all this chest-thumping is not for parting with any of their personal, often ill-gotten wealth, but to give public money back to the public! And in the process, make deserving beneficiaries seem like beggars with the politicos posturing as munificient donors. The trick is to make the people feel ‘obliged’, for the ultimate trade-off, namely their vote. Elections, the inevitable democratic disaster, after all, are not very far off!
It may sound crude, but a natural disaster is the greatest boon for politicos. But they are not the only exploiters. These days, disaster management and relief work, is also big business. There are now, scores of NGOs for whom people’s hunger and deprivation are actually bread and butter. TN has the dubious distinction of having the maximum number of registered NGOs. There is no check either on their source of funds or their end-use. On the contrary even the officialdom in several districts relies on them to deliver relief. The NGOs to their credit are very meticulous and extremely media savvy. Barring a few genuine ones, most are fly by night operators flush with funds from, often, well-meaning and unsuspecting donors.
Already, there are a number of complaints about the quality of their relief work, particularly post tsunami: Many boats, distributed with much fan-fare, were not sea-worthy, while several shelters built by them are more leaky than the sky! But, rest assured, there is no lack of tell-tale signs of their ‘charity’, with pompous nameboards displaying their names! We will see more again as the floods recede and relief(?) work takes over.
Really, after the visit of a disaster, the bigger disaster is the visit of the VIPs and of course, the aforementioned ‘good Samaritans’! And once a disaster becomes stale news and the media moves over to more ‘humane’ issues like, say, pre-marital sex, these champions too vanish, leaving behind hapless people with not only broken lives and broken homes, but also holding broken promises!
Can’t we give gracefully? Is donating for a cause a natural human instinct or a contrived photo opportunity? Is what is on balance the lives and future of tragedy-struck people or mere publicity sweepstakes and sinful profit? Does it really matter to the needy who gives? Should human misery be trivialised thus? After all, does not God himself remain anonymous?

"The pros, cons and the politics of strikes",https://newstodaynet.com/2005/09/04/the-pros-cons-and-the-politics-of-strikes/,"September 4, 2005",Jawahar T R,Politics,"Onions and Unions have this common habit of bringing tears to one’s eyes when cut up. But while in the case of onions the tears are worth the trouble, the latter can never justify the hardship that they routinely pose to the citizenry. But having said that we must also admit that these days, thankfully, the nuisance value of the unions is progressively declining. The strike by the transport workers a couple of days back is a telling example of that. It is a happy pointer to the growing irrelevance of this scourge called unionism. That’s all that is left of Marx’s Left.
None can grudge the sweat and blood spilt by the toiling class to earn even a single meal. Nor can any one deny their right to organise themselves to get a fair deal or for better working conditions. But the moot point is that can those who are hitting the streets with strike calls with alarming frequency truly be called the toiling class? Nothing can be more perverse than that. Who are the habitual strikers of the modern world? Bankmen. Government employees. PSU employees. Postal staff. And of course, Transport staff. If these are deemed the working class ordained by Karl Marx, then someone down the generations has obviously tampered with the original manuscript.
For, Marx’s comrades really had nothing to lose but their chains. But the current strikers have everything to gain by scooting work for a day and shouting slogans, as they invariably emerge richer after every such outing. In the past, feudal lords and industry captains made slaves out of farmers and labourers who were paid measly wages after endless hours of work in exacting working conditions. Unionism was meant to fight this kind of exploitation. Can these ‘provocations’ apply to the current crop of strikers? If anything they are the best positioned amongst all the classes of masses who inhabit this purportedly socialist society. Neither are their pay packets measly, nor are the working conditions stifling to warrant frequent strolls down the streets. And they possess something that the rest of the countrymen can’t dream of: Job security and through that, life security. And for all this, their accountability levels are abominable. For them to strike seeking even more does smack of greed of the insatiable kind. From losing chains to windfall gains, indeed, Marx’s children have come a long way.
Instead, there is a kind of inverted exploitation. It is the ‘employers’ of these ‘public servants’ who are the worst hit. The tax-payers who foot their burgeoning salary bills are never in the reckoning when giving strike calls. After all, they hold the reins of virtually all the essential services and when they strike, the rest of the country sighs: Oh no not again! And after having screwed up the routines of the commoner, the strikers also have the temerity to claim success. Indeed, their success is directly proportional to the agony caused to public and damage to public property. How sadistic! Marx may get a ‘red’ face at this if alive.
And to the next vital question that flows from the above. May be some good dialectics by our very enlightned comrades can throw up an answer. Who are the enemies of this ‘particular breed of working class’? Frankly, nobody. And that precisely is the unionist rope trick. Tilting at windmills. By projecting the abstract State as an oppressor, the captains of labour had over the decades, very successfully built a whole movement and, of course, a good career for themselves. And while the impotent State, run by self-serving, vote-bank conscious politicians could be depended upon to bend to their threats, union leaders have for their part made the most of it, becoming a sort of dadas by themselves with a mob at their disposal to rise to their bidding. In some public sector undertakings, there are life-time labour leaders who do not quit office even after retiring from service! Marx was right ..No, Left for sure, but I meant right ie., correct. The State was indeed withering away.
The reality is that these leaders never had any collective bargaining powers under law as they used to parade before their unsuspecting followers, but who dared call their bluff? PSU and Government staff were easy to organise, easy to mobilise and easy to tempt too, with carrots. They offered a wholesale plum catch for the leaders to swell their memberships. Really, by true definition, these groups constituted the bourgeoise that Marxism’s torch bearers were ordained to fight. But ironically, it is only those who cannot be even remotely, deemed proletariat who formed the cadre of the comrades. That is Marx, turned on his head.
And enter, politics. Politicos and unions breed, butter and back-scratch each other. Every party has its own affiliated union. Today, unionism is a facade, a tradeable one at that. As the political-ins and political-outs slug it out, unionism is just another weapon in their sordid battles. We had a glimpse of it during the latest transport strike. With the transport staff divided down the middle on political lines, the response to the government’s announcements also followed suit. One section celebrated while others protested. And, neither made any impact. No marks here for Marx’s pampered progeny.
The SC has put them in place. The people are sick of them. Aah, we must now be actually encouraging the strikers. The more they shirk, the more they will shrink. Till they join Marx.

It’s back to religion with our backs to politics,https://newstodaynet.com/2002/03/08/its-back-to-religion-with-our-backs-to-politics/,"March 8, 2002",Jawahar T R,Politics,"Man may be a political animal or not, but he certainly is a religious animal. Of course, there may be secular exceptions warranting an invention of a nomenclature ‘secular animals’, but even so, such secularism is selective and is always laced with reverence for the minority religions and its’ gods.
Reason why these secularists do not raise their atheistic or agnostic hackles w.r.t religions other than Hinduism, no doubt out of sheer respect for minorities and not out of any hatred for Hinduism as we are reminded by them often. May be Hinduism will earn their sympathy if it becomes a minority religion. Or a better alternative would be to export these secularists to countries where Hinduism is already in a minority.
So by virtue of their super secularism that recognises only minority gods, – and thank god for that, minor mercy though it is – they too are in a way religious. And so, coming back to the point, man remains more a religious animal than a political one, despite his overwhelming preoccupation with politics of all kinds. Because, when everything else fails, the last resort has always been religion. Religion not only antiquates politics, but dwarfs the latter by its sheer immensity, reach and appeal.
And per se there is nothing wrong with that. It is only out of our delusion that we tend to jump into a self-denial mode when religion is discussed in public. In private, let alone the man on the street, even the greatest of judges, the most accomplished of doctors and popular leaders of the people have all been very religious men and women.
A colleague by my side tells me that an old enlightened bird had even said that ‘religion is the most serious business of the human race…’. Also, the self inflicted feeling of guilt is an affliction that ails only the majority religion. The minorities, never tend to feel shy of displaying their religious faith and in fact that is the primary bond that unites them.
And perhaps this cohesiveness is what also makes them attractive to politicians who are ever on the look out for captive vote banks. Really it is politics that has infringed on religion in the mindspace of the people, dominating their thought, dictating their actions and finally leading them to doom.
And then religion comes back with a bang for at the end of the day, out of sheer frustration and hopelessness everyone says, ‘oh God’. No one, not even an incurable political sycophant, says ‘oh Vajpayee’, or ‘oh Sonia’ or ‘oh Laloo’ or for that matter, ‘oh Mrs. Laloo’! The nation today is on one such threshold, getting itself ready to heave a collective ‘oh God’.
While religion, in its true sense, is all pervading, all encompassing and is the essence of human nature and existence, politics is a pastime that has now become a pain. One can certainly do without politics but never without religion. Only blinkered minds would believe that religion could be kept out of politics. And hypocrites would keep harping on the dangers of mixing religion and politics while every action they commit is based on some holy book, or teaching or at least in the name and belief of the Almighty.
The question itself does not arise as man is essentially religious, and whatever he does also carries that imprint barring the real atheists who are a minority. It may not manifest itself so openly but the fact remains that it is the underlying reality behind all that is happening.
So, one should, instead of denying reality, welcome it if religion takes charge of politics. It can only be to the overall good of the people because all religions in their original form only preach peace while all politics in whatever form thrive on discord! While a dose of politics injected into religion might corrupt religion, it may actually bring some semblance of sanity if it is the other way round. In any case what have the politicians done to the people in all these years that they had at their disposal?
One can be sure that sensible and responsible religious leaders can certainly make things better or at least, not any worse, for they can never plunge any deeper than the politicos. That they may fail is a possibility. That they should not fail is an imperative.
One has to view the role of the Kanchi seer in the Ayodhya issue only in this perspective. The imbroglio is basically a religious one and it is only such people who have the basic understanding and sensitivities associated with religion and faith, any religion or faith, who can adjudicate on it with conviction, fairness and moderation.
The Shankaracharya can strike a better rapport with his Muslim counterparts because he can understand their language and talk their language, the language of faith, and at the same time present his side with genuineness, something no politician can ever do with all his gift of the gab. And while in politics it is a matter of the winner taking it all, in religion the stress is always on sharing, irrespective of who wins.
If such an atmosphere is created, the issue could be resolved with even a decisive court verdict becoming irrelevant. So let’s vote for religion, this time, no matter if politicians lose the deposits in their vote banks!

Chennai: Tamil legislators from Sri Lanka have sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s help in ensuring that the island nation’s government addresses the long-pending Tamil question with a lasting political solution.
A delegation of Tamil leaders met with the Indian High Commissioner in Colombo Gopal Baglay and handed over the letter to seek India’s help in safeguarding Tamil interests in the country.
Led by senior Tamil leader of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) R Sampanthan, the letter was signed by popular leaders including Mavai Senathiraja, Dharmalingam Sithadthan, and Selvam Adaikalanathan, former Northern Province Chief Minister CV Wigneswaran and former MP Suresh Premachandran.
In their letter, the leaders have asked for India’s help in ensuring unfulfilled promises made by the Sri Lankan government while implementing the 13th amendment and to seek a long-term political solution in this regard.
The amendment highlights rights given to the Tamil community and increases their influence in the politics of the region.
Mentioning the interventions made by the Indian political leadership at different points the letter also highlighted Modi’s address to the Sri Lankan Parliament in 2015, when he spoke of his firm belief in ‘cooperative federalism’.

Mukesh Verma posted his resignation on Twitter and surfaced at the home of Swami Prasad Maurya, who started the exodus.
‘Swami Prasad Maurya is our leader. We will support whatever decision he takes. Many other leaders will join us in the coming days,’ he said.
Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh BJP core group has been working to shortlist probable candidates for the Assembly elections, especially for the seats which will go to the polls in the initial phases. Filing of nomination for the first phase of the seven-phase Uttar Pradesh polls is set to begin from 14 January.
In the meantime, the Congress today released the first list of candidates for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, which will begin on February 10. The party has given substantial representation to women in the upcoming elections, general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said.
‘Out of the total 125 candidates, 40 per cent are women and 40 per cent are youth. With this historic initiative, we hope to bring in a new kind of politics in the State,’ she said at a virtual meeting.
In the BJP alliance, reports said Apna Dal leader Anupriya Patel is asking for between 30 to 35 seats, but will likely be accomodated around 15-17 seats. This is more than what the BJP gave to Apna Dal in 2017.
Similarly, the BJP is likely to accommodate between 15 to 17 seats to Nishad Party also. Nishad Party is likely to get seats in Gorakhpur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Jaunpur, Sultanpur and Rampur Districts.

Suu Kyi sentenced to 4 more years in prison,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/11/suu-kyi-sentenced-to-4-more-years-in-prison/,"January 11, 2022",Agency,Politics,"Aung San Suu Kyi
Myanmar: A court in Myanmar sentenced ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to four more years in prison on Monday after finding her guilty of illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies and violating coronavirus restrictions, a legal official said.
Suu Kyi was convicted last month on two other charges and given a four-year prison sentence, which was then halved by the head of the military-installed government.
The cases are among about a dozen brought against the 76-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate since the army seized power last February, ousting her elected government and arresting top members of her National League for Democracy party.
If found guilty of all the charges, she could be sentenced to more than 100 years in prison.
Suu Kyi’s supporters and independent analysts say the charges against her are contrived to legitimise the military’s seizure of power and prevent her from returning to politics.
Monday’s verdict in the court in the capital, Naypyitaw, was conveyed by a legal official who insisted on anonymity for fear of being punished by the authorities, who have restricted the release of information about Suu Kyi’s trials.
He said she was sentenced to two years in prison under the Export-Import Law for importing the walkie-talkies and one year under the Telecommunications Law for possessing them. The sentences are to be served concurrently. She also received a two-year sentence under the Natural Disaster Management Law for allegedly violating coronavirus rules while campaigning.
Suu Kyi was convicted last month on two other charges incitement and breaching Covid-19 restrictions and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. Hours after that sentence was issued, the head of the military-installed government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, reduced it by half.
Suu Kyi’s party won a landslide victory in a 2020 general election, but the military claimed there was widespread electoral fraud, an assertion that independent poll watchers doubt.
Since her first guilty verdict, Suu Kyi has been attending court hearings in prison clothes a white top and a brown longyi skirt provided by the authorities. She is being held by the military at an unknown location, where state television reported last month she would serve her sentence.
The hearings are closed to the media and spectators and the prosecutors do not comment. Her lawyers, who had been a source of information on the proceedings, were served with gag orders in October.
The military-installed government has not allowed any outside party to meet with Suu Kyi since it seized power, despite international pressure for talks including her that could ease the country’s violent political crisis.
It would not allow a special envoy from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, to meet her. The refusal received a rare rebuke from fellow members, who barred Min Aung Hlaing from attending its annual summit meeting.

The State Election Commission will release the final voters list on 9 December. The poll body is holding back to back meetings with officials on holding the elections. Dates are expected to be announced soon.
On their part, the political parties are gearing up to face the polls. The ruling DMK is getting ready for the urban local body polls in the State, particularly in the western districts. The party is in no mood to suffer another defeat in Coimbatore, where it lost all the 10 seats in the Assembly elections.
‘We have to win all the wards in the city corporation, municipalities and town panchayats in the district,’ Electricity Minister V Senthil Balaji told the party workers at a recent meeting.
The main opposition AIADMK on Wednesday moved a plea before the Madras High Court seeking directions to the State Election Commission to ensure free and fair conduct of urban local body elections.
AIADMK represented by its organisation secretary and former minister D Jayakumar has moved the petition stating that there were several illegal activities that were unfolded against the AIADMK candidates in the recent rural local body elections.
The PMK is changing its organisational structure in the run-up to elections to the urban local bodies.
The exercise, which is likely to be completed by this year-end, will empower the district secretaries, putting them in charge of two or three Assembly constituencies.
Both DMK and AIADMK have already invited applications from contestants for all posts in the urban local bodies. The DMDK, which quit the AIADMK alliance before the 2021 polls, will contest alone and has asked its cadres who are willing to contest to apply for the same.

"With migrants in mind, Pope visits divided Cyprus",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/01/with-migrants-in-mind-pope-visits-divided-cyprus/,"December 1, 2021",Agency,Politics,"Pope Francis
Nicosia: Pope Francis visits Cyprus this week to lend his support to a conflict-riven island now on the front line of a new migratory route for people fleeing their countries for Europe. In central Nicosia, nothing tells the story of an influx in arrivals more than the small courtyard area outside the Church of the Holy Cross. Each morning migrants queue for aid and assistance from a Catholic charity.
Aid workers say the situation is overwhelming. Francis, who has made defence of migrants and refugees a cornerstone of his papacy, has arranged to have 50 migrants relocated to Italy after his trip this week. He plans an ecumenical prayer with migrants at Holy Cross on Dec. 3 after Mass at an outdoor stadium in Nicosia in the morning.
I am thinking of those who, in recent years, and still today, have been fleeing from war and poverty, landing on the shores of the continent or elsewhere, and finding not hospitality, but hostility and even exploitation, Francis said in a video message ahead of his visit. They are our brothers and sisters.
In addition to its proximity to the volatile Middle East, Cyprus has found itself in a sticky spot for reasons of its own complex geopolitics. Split between its ethnic Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Cyprus has a porous 180-km (116-mile) ceasefire line cleaving it east to west that has been used by people traffickers as a back door into the government-controlled south. This year alone more than 90 percent of those who came to the south used this route.
Right now we are overwhelmed with the number of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees who are here in Cyprus, said Elizabeth V. Kassinis, executive manager of Caritas Cyprus, part of a global network of Catholic relief and aid organisations. She said the charity, which provides aid ranging from assistance with paperwork to clothing and food parcels, has recently been assisting up to 400 people daily compared with between 150-200 in the past.
Many are pinning hopes on the pope bringing them better days. The pope can change many things because the pope represents Jesus Christ … if you follow God you cannot lose anything, said Antoinette Ndjikeu, 50, from Cameroon.
Father Jerzy (George) Kraj, Latin Patriarchal Vicar and Attache of the Apostolic Nunciature in Nicosia, said the ecumenical prayer with Pope Francis at Holy Cross would take place with representatives of Christian communities in Cyprus. This is what unites us … We are not only preaching, but doing the charity, he said.
Holy Cross itself reflects the bizarre nature of Cyprus and its division since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. The upper walls of the sandstone church are still pockmarked with bullet holes from 1974, and a United Nations sentry post is on an abandoned building opposite.
Briefing reporters at the Vatican on Tuesday, spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pope will mention the division. It’s a wound that has been open for some time. The Holy See undoubtedly supports every effort to strengthen bilateral talks, which are the only solution for the island and its people, he said.
Francis will overnight in no-man’s-land. The Franciscan monastery adjacent to Holy Cross lies in a buffer zone running through the heart of the medieval city where most other buildings have lain rotting and abandoned for years. The rooms may be small and modest, but the pope will have everything he needs, said Kraj.
Its rear garden, surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, backs onto the Turkish Cypriot side of Nicosia. A bust at the entrance of the monastery is dedicated to Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005. Build Bridges, Not Walls, reads the plaque beneath the bust.

"War of words between DMK, BJP over Nadda’s dynasty charge",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/29/war-of-words-between-dmk-bjp-over-naddas-dynasty-charge/,"November 29, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"Chennai: Continuing its attack on BJP president J P Nadda for terming DMK as a party that practices dynastic politics, DMK said BJP has no moral authority to talk about dynastic politics as wards of several BJP leaders are made MPs and MLA.
Nadda, speaking at a meeting in Coimbatore last week, had commented on the DMK and said, ‘It is a dynastic rule. It is a family rule. You can’t imagine anyone from outside the family becoming leaders in the DMK.’
In a hard-hitting article in party organ Murasoli, DMK said citing a report that there were 45 BJP MPs were family members of party leaders. ‘In Karnataka, when Yeddiyurappa was the Chief Minister, his elder son was an MP and younger son was state BJP general secretary. The current Chief Minister Baswaraj Bommai was also son of former CM S R Bommai,’ the article said.
The list of names from north India, pointed out in the article, is much longer and includes the likes of Piyush Goel, son of former Union Minister Ved Prakas Goel; Varun Gandhi, son of former Union Minister Menaka Gandhi; Anurag Thakur, son of former Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dumal; Pankaj Singh, son of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh; Dushyant Singh, son of former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia; and Abhishek Singh, son of former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh.
Taking a dig at Nadda, DMK asked if the BJP president would remove Basavaraj Bommai from the post of Chief Minister to do away with dynastic politics and protect democracy.

Editorial: Dragon dominance,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/23/editorial-dragon-dominance/,"November 23, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday said his country will not seek dominance over Southeast Asia or bully its smaller neighbours, amid ongoing friction over the South China Sea. Xi made the remarks during a virtual conference with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, held to mark the 30th anniversary of relations between China and the grouping.
Two diplomats said ASEAN member Myanmar was not represented at Monday’s meeting after its military-installed government refused to allow an ASEAN envoy to meet with ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other arrested politicians. Military ruler Gen. Min Aung Hlaing was also barred from representing his country at the last ASEAN summit.
China has repeatedly sought to overcome concerns about its rising power and influence in the region, particularly its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea that overlaps the claims of ASEAN members Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines. China resolutely opposes hegemonism and power politics, wishes to maintain friendly relations with its neighbours and jointly nurture lasting peace in the region and absolutely will not seek hegemony or even less, bully the small, Xi said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Xi’s remarks came days after Chinese coast guard ships blocked and sprayed a powerful stream of water at two Philippine boats carrying supplies to troops at a disputed South China Sea shoal and forced them to turn back. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte highlighted the incident in his remarks at the conference, referring to the shoal by its Philippine name.
We abhor the recent event in the Ayungin Shoal and view with grave concern other similar developments. This does not speak well of the relations between our nations and our partnership, Duterte said, according to a statement from his office. Duterte also called on China to respect the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which establishes maritime entitlements and sovereign rights over maritime zones, along with a 2016 Hague arbitration ruling that mostly invalidated China’s South China Sea claims. China has refused to recognise the ruling. We must fully utilise these legal tools to ensure that the South China Sea remains a sea of peace, stability and prosperity, Duterte said.
On Monday, the Philippines redeployed the two supply boats to provide food to the marines based at Second Thomas Shoal aboard a World War II-era warship which it deliberately ran aground in 1999 in a move to fortify the country’s claim. Chinese vessels have surrounded the shoal and demanded the Philippines tow away the ship, the BRP Sierra Madre. At a daily briefing Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reasserted China’s position rejecting the 2016 arbitration ruling and claiming that its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are backed by sufficient historical and legal basis. Any attempt to challenge China’s sovereignty and interests will not succeed, Zhao told reporters.

However, a section of Vanniyar Sangam expressed dissatisfaction at Gnanvel’s regret. They said it is for Suriya to say and wonder where he has gone now.
Remember Vanniyar Sangam issued a legal notice to Suriya as well as the filmmaker seeking Rs 5 cr damages. PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss had even issued a letter questioning Suriya for the act. The blatter replied saying there should be no place for politics in films and one should refrain from making any issues on names in films.

Editorial: The Xi factor,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/09/editorial-the-xi-factor/,"November 9, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"China’s leader Xi Jinping appears to be laying the foundation for a third term in power as top officials of the all-powerful Communist Party meet this week in Beijing.
The official Xinhua News Agency said President and party general secretary Xi issued a draft resolution on the party’s ‘major achievements and historical experience’ at the Central Committee’s plenary session that opened on Monday.
Scholars say that will mark the party’s third major statement on its 100-year history, shoring up Xi’s status as an equal to founder of the Chinese People’s Republic Mao Zedong and his successor Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw crucial economic reforms. China removed term limits on the presidency in 2018, potentially keeping Xi at the apex of power for the rest of his life.
He is expected to be reappointed party leader through a highly opaque process at next year’s full party congress, an event held every five years. This week’s meeting of the roughly 200 members of the Central Committee is due to last through Thursday, with a communique to be issued following the final session.
A decade after taking over the leadership, Xi faces no apparent rivals within the party and has consolidated power by overseeing a stable economy, an assertive foreign policy, a major upgrading of the military and an ongoing crackdown on corruption that has ensnared both serving and retired high-level officials. At the same time, religious groups and human rights activists have been harshly repressed, with more than a million members of Muslim minority groups subjected to mass detentions and political indoctrination.
Free speech and opposition politics have also been severely curtailed in the semi-autonomous southern city of Hong Kong and military threats stepped up against self-governing Taiwan. As immediate neighbour, India too faced threats during Xi regime, though he made a visit to the country and held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mamallapuram.

Modi’s commitment towards climate action with India promising to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 appears to have been taken with global strategic landscape in mind. His speech at the COP26 indicates that India is all for saving the planet without inhibiting India’s economic growth and at the same time monitoring other countries walk the talk on countering climate change.
Modi’s statement takes into account the reality that India has the lowest per capita income in the top twenty grouping with Indonesia, South Africa ahead on multiple figures and China nearly four times ahead.
India stood out among top emitters, including the U.S. and China, that were being closely watched at the conference. President Joe Biden, hamstrung by politics at home, didn’t bring anything substantially new to the table.
Meanwhile China’s Xi Jinping didn’t attend in person and offered no new plans to cut emissions.

OPS’ remarks on Sasikala triggers row in AIADMK,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/26/ops-remarks-on-sasikala-triggers-row-in-aiadmk/,"October 26, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"Chennai: Former Tamilnadu Chief Minister and coordinator of the Opposition AIADMK O Panneerselvam has said any decision on reinducting ousted leader V K Sasikala into the party would be taken by the top office-bearers of the party.
Asked about reports of Sasikala, claiming herself as the general secretary of the party and calling for strengthening the AIADMK, Panneerselvam said top office-bearers of the party will discuss and take a decision on re-inducting her into the party.
‘Anyone can come into politics. But it was people’s wish to accept them”, Panneerselvam, said, adding, the party has been functioning under the leadership of the coordinator and joint coordinator.
Sasikala, the former close aide of late J Jayalalithaa, was earlier appointed as interim general secretary of the party, but was expelled after the warring AIADMK factions merged in August 2017.
Panneerselvam’s remarks appeared to be contradictory to the stand adopted by former CM and AIADMK joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami, who had been asserting that there was no room for the ousted interim general secretary in the party.
Palaniswami had been stating that the questiong of readmitting Sasikala into the AIADMK did not arise as she was not a member of the party.
He also took objections to Sasikala using the AIADMK flag and unveiling a plaque at the memorial house of late leader MGR in the capacity as general secretary of the party.
Reacting to Panneerselvam’s remarks, former Minister and senior party leader D Jayakumar said he would like to remind to OPS that it was him (Panneerselvam) who stood against Sasikala.
It may be recalled that it was Panneerselvam who openly opposed Sasikala after the death of J Jayallaithaa in February 2017 by launching a dharmayudh against her, stating that he was forced to resign from the
Chief Minister’s post by her.
The revolt by Paneerselvam led to a split in the party and Palaniswami became the Chief Minister.
However, after Sasikala’s aspirations to become Chief Minister was shattered when a Special Court sentenced her to four years imprisonment in DA case, the warring factions of the AIADMK headed by Panneerselvam
and Palaniswami merged and Sasikala was sacked from the party.

During their meeting at the Huber Presidential Mansion along the shores of the Bosphorus Strait, the two leaders on Saturday discussed ties between Turkey and Germany, Ankara’s membership bid to the European Union, irregular migration, and a series of regional issues, reports Xinhua news agency.
The Turkish leader said at a joint press conference with Merkel that racism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, and discrimination remain the main problem for the Turkish community in Europe, calling on European nations to take effective measures against all discriminatory treatments and racist attacks.
Erdogan expressed hope that the successful process carried out with the outgoing Chancellor would continue with the new German government in the upcoming period.
For her part, Merkel said that the EU’s support to Turkey on irregular migration would continue, noting “our peace and security are attached to the other”.
Turkey, a key transit point for asylum seekers on their way to Europe, hosts more than 4 million refugees, including 3.6 million Syrians, within its borders. The country has been lately witnessing an increased influx of Afghan refugees fleeing turmoil in their homeland.
Merkel will retire from politics after 16 years as Chancellor following the national elections held in September.

US Senate reaches deal on short-term debt-limit extension,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/08/us-senate-reaches-deal-on-short-term-debt-limit-extension/,"October 8, 2021",Agency,Politics,"Chuck Schumer
Washington: US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced of reaching an agreement with the Republicans to extend the federal government’s debt limit into December.
We have reached agreement to extend the debt ceiling through early December, and it’s our hope that we can get this done as soon as today, Schumer said on the Senate floor on Thursday.
The deal reached between Schumer and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell would raise the statutory debt limit by $480 billion, which would allow the Treasury Department to meet obligations through December 3, Xinhua news agency quoted a Bloomberg News report as saying.
The deal came as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen repeatedly warned that the US could default on its debt if Congress fails to raise or suspend the debt limit before October 18.
I do regard October 18th as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government’s bills, for us to be in a position where we lack the resources to pay the government’s bills, Yellen said on Tuesday in an interview with CNBC News.
The White House on Thursday called the short-term debt limit extension a positive step forward, signaling support for the deal.
And it gives us some breathing room from the catastrophic default we were approaching because of Senator McConnell’s decision to play politics with our economy, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.
Addressing the debt limit shouldn’t be a partisan football. This is about paying the debt that both parties have already incurred,Jean-Pierre said.
The Senate is expected to vote on the bill to extend the debt limit and it will require 60 votes to end debate on the legislation.
As part of a bipartisan budget deal enacted in August 2019, Congress suspended the debt limit through July 31.
After the debt limit was reinstated on August 1, the Treasury Department began using extraordinary measures to continue to finance the government on a temporary basis.
The debt limit, commonly called the debt ceiling, is the total amount of money that the US government is authorised to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, including social security and medicare benefits, interest on the national debt, and other payments.

Corruption trial of Suu Kyi hears payoff claim,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/02/corruption-trial-of-suu-kyi-hears-payoff-claim/,"October 2, 2021",Agency,Politics,"Aung San Suu Kyi
Pyong Yong: A former ally of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s leader ousted in a February military takeover, testified at her corruption trial on Friday that he had handed to her large amounts of cash and gold in proceedings supporters say are meant to discredit her.
A Special Court in the capital Naypyitaw is hearing four corruption cases against Suu Kyi, each of which carries a penalty of up to 15 years’ imprisonment, the longest possible prison terms of the several offenses she has been charged with.
All the proceedings against the 76-year-old Suu Kyi are closed to the public and press. She has been detained by the military at an undisclosed location in Naypyitaw.
Like other top members of her party and government, Phyo Min Thein, who testified Friday, was arrested by the military when it took power on Feb 1. The allegations of payoffs were first raised in March by the military government and have been denied by her lawyers.
She faces two charges of accepting bribes and two of conspiring to carry out corruption in connection with real estate transactions. A fifth corruption charge has not yet gone to trial.
Phyo Min Thein, a top figure in Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party who held the important job of chief minister for Yangon Region before the military seized power, testified for the prosecution. He said that he had personally handed over $600,000 and seven gold bars to Suu Kyi in 2017-18, lawyer Min Soe said.
The military at a March news conference had presented a videotape of Phyo Min Thein making the same allegations. In his court testimony, he added that he presented Suu Kyi with a statue from a prominent Buddhist monk, Min Soe said.
Suu Kyi’s supporters and independent analysts say all the charges against her are politically motivated and an attempt to discredit her and legitimize the military’s seizure of power while keeping her from returning to politics.
Suu Kyi is also being tried on lesser charges of sedition, two counts of flouting COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, illegally importing walkie-talkies and the unlicensed use of the radios.
Preparations have also begun to try her for breaching the official secrets law, which carried a maximum prison term of 14 years.
The military said it seized power because last November’s election, won in a landslide by Suu Kyi’s party, was tainted by massive fraud. Its claim has almost no independent support, and the takeover was quickly met by widespread public protests.
Security forces used deadly force to try to quash the peaceful protests, killing more than 1,100 people, according to the detailed tallies of the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners and human rights groups. Opponents of military rule have turned to armed self-defense, sabotage and killings of soldiers and officials on a near-daily basis.

As new leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Kishida is certain to be elected the next prime minister on Monday in parliament, where his party and coalition partner control the house.
Kishida beat popular vaccinations minister Taro Kono in a runoff after finishing only one vote ahead of him in the first round where none of the four candidates, including two women, was able to win a majority.
Results showed Kishida had more support from party heavyweights who apparently chose stability over change advocated by Kono, who is known as something of a maverick.
The new leader is under pressure to change the party’s high-handed reputation worsened by Suga, who angered the public over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and insistence on holding the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
The long-ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party desperately needs to quickly turn around plunging public support ahead of lower house elections coming within two months.
Kishida called for growth and distribution under his new capitalism, saying that the economy under Japan’s longest-serving Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had only benefited big companies.
Overall, little change is expected in key diplomatic and security policies under the new leader, said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.
All of the candidates support close Japan-U.S. security ties and partnerships with other like-minded democracies in Asia and Europe, in part to counter China’s growing influence and a threat from nuclear-armed North Korea.
Wednesday’s vote was seen as a test of whether the party can move out of Abe’s shadow. His influence in government and party affairs has largely muzzled diverse views and shifted the party to the right.
Kishida is also seen as a choice who could prolong an era of unusual political stability amid fears that Japan could return to revolving door leadership.
Concern is not about individuals but stability of Japanese politics, Michael Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told a telephone briefing ahead of the vote. It’s about whether or not we are entering a period in Japanese politics of instability and short-term prime ministership, he said. It makes it very hard to move forward on agenda.
Suga is leaving only a year after taking office as a pinch hitter for Abe, who suddenly resigned over health problems, ending his nearly eight-year leadership, the longest in Japan’s constitutional history.

"Trudeau wins 3rd term, fails to get majority",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/22/trudeau-wins-3rd-term-fails-to-get-majority/,"September 22, 2021",Agency,Politics,"File photo of Justin Trudeau
Toronto: Canadians returned Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to power Monday in hotly contested elections against a rookie conservative leader, but he failed to gain an absolute majority, according to projections by television networks.
Trudeau called the snap election last month, hoping to parlay a smooth Covid-19 vaccine rollout — among the best in the world — into a new mandate to steer the nation’s pandemic exit and pass his agenda without opposition support.
But after a bumpy five weeks of campaigning, his voice was raspy and he appeared set for a repeat of the close 2019 general election that resulted in the one-time golden boy of Canadian politics clinging to power yet weakened after losing his majority in parliament.
You (Canadians) are sending us back to work with a clear mandate to get through this pandemic into brighter days ahead,” Trudeau said, flanked by his wife Sophie Gregoire and their children on stage at a victory gala. That’s exactly what we are ready to do, he said.
At 49, Trudeau had faced tougher political bouts and still came out unscathed.  After six years in power, however, his administration is showing signs of fatigue, and it was an uphill battle for him to convince Canadians to stick with his Liberals after falling short of high expectations set in his 2015 landslide win.
Trudeau ‘lied to us’. Throughout the day, long lineups outside polling stations were observed by journalists in several major cities.
Douglas O’Hara, 73, casting a ballot in Trudeau’s Montreal electoral district of Papineau, said earlier that he was “very disappointed” with the prime minister.
Although he believes Trudeau “did a half-decent job” managing the pandemic, he recalled that the leader had pledged not to go to the polls until the outbreak had subsided.
Then as soon as he gets a chance (when) he thinks he’s going to get a majority, he calls an election, O’Hara said. I really believe he lied to us.
In Ottawa, Kai Anderson, 25, said Canada’s pandemic response was her number one issue. I think the prime minister did a good job managing the pandemic, she said.
Liz Maier, 72, of Vancouver said she too hoped for a Trudeau win for consistency in leadership during the public health crisis.
Entering the final stretch of the contest, Liberals and Conservatives — the two main political parties that have ruled Canada since its 1867 confederation — were virtually tied, with about 31 percent support each in public opinion polls, and four smaller factions nipping at their heels.

Washington: Former US President George W. Bush has warned against domestic extremism, saying the country has seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders but from the violence that gathers within.
There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home, said Bush in a speech on Saturday marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks at the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our continuing duty to confront them, he said.
Bush, who was in his first year as president when the horrific attacks took place, paid tribute to the passengers and crew members of Flight 93, which crashed in a field after those on board fought back against the hijackers and diverted them from their intended target.
The former Republican President lamented the division in the US, contrasting the current political climate to the spirit of unity that he said he observed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.
A malign force seems at work in our common life that turns every disagreement into an argument, and every argument into a clash of cultures. So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear, and resentment, Bush said.
That leaves us worried about our nation and our future together. Bush has been outspoken about condemning violent insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol on January 6 in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results for President Joe Biden.

Canadian PM Trudeau to call election for 20 September,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/08/13/canadian-pm-trudeau-to-call-election-for-20-september/,"August 13, 2021",Agency,Politics,"File photo of Justin Trudeau
Toronto: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will announce Sunday he is calling a snap election for September 20, an official familiar with the plans told The Associated Press.
The source, who was not authorised to talk publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the election date on Thursday.
Trudeau is seeking to win the majority of seats in Parliament. His Liberal party fell just short of that two years ago and must rely on the opposition to pass legislation.
Trudeau wants to capitalise on the fact that Canada is now one of the most fully vaccinated countries in the world.
Canada’s prime minister is less personally popular than he once was but his government’s handling of the pandemic has been widely viewed as a success. Canada has enough vaccines for every citizen and the country flattened the epidemic curve while spending hundreds of billions to prop up the economy amid lockdowns.
Justin Trudeau’s accomplishment was to preside over a government that came up with financial, health and unemployment policies that carried us through COVID. That’s what he’s done and what he’ll run on, said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto.
Daniel Beland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal, noted that Trudeau was criticised for a slow start in acquiring vaccines but is now benefiting from having more than enough for every eligible Canadian.
They want to exploit this moment, Beland said. Beland also said Trudeau is taking advantage of weak opposition.
Trudeaumania is over. If the Liberals get a majority government it will be in part because of the weakness of the opposition parties. The conservatives are divided, he said.
The 49-year-old Trudeau, the son of the late iconic Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, became the second-youngest prime minister in Canadian history when he was first elected with a majority of seats in Parliament in 2015. He reasserted liberalism in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative Party government in Canada, but scandals combined with high expectations damaged his prospects.
His father served as prime minister from 1968 to 1984 with a short interruption and remains one of the few Canadian politicians known in other countries.

The apex court directed that political parties must publish the criminal antecedents of candidates within 48 hours of their selection.
A bench of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai modified its 13 February, 2020, judgment in this regard. The Supreme Court was hearing a contempt plea seeking action against political parties which failed to declare and publicise criminal antecedents of their candidates.
Last month, the Supreme Court said the legislature was ‘not likely to do anything’ to prevent criminals from entering politics and standing for elections. In its February 2020 judgment, linked to the Bihar Assembly election, the Supreme Court said candidates must upload these details either within 48 hours of their selection or at least two weeks before the first date for filing of nomination papers.
The Supreme Court has held eight political parties, including the BJP and Congress, guilty of contempt for not making public criminal records of their poll candidates. The top court imposed fine of Rs 5 lakh each on National Communist Party (NCP) and CPI(M) for not following the order in last year’s Bihar assembly polls, and Rs 1 lakh each on BJP, Congress, Janata Dal, RJD, CPI and LJP.
The action came soon after the bench directed political parties to make public criminal records of their poll candidates within 48 hours of their selection. Politics should not be a safe haven for criminals.

Chennai: At a time when there were talks about carving out Kongu Naadu, Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs Nityanand Rai today informed the Parliament that there is no proposal of bifurcation of Tamilnadu.
In response to a question raised by Perambalur MP T R Paarivendhar, Nityanand said in Lok Sabha, “Demands and representations are received from time to time from various individuals and organisations for creation of new States. Creation of a new State has wide ramification and direct bearing on the federal polity of our country. Government moves on the matter of formation of new States after taking into consideration all relevant factors. Presently no such proposal is under consideration.”
Paarivendhar had asked if the Union government has any proposal to bifurcate any State in the country including Tamilnadu.
He also asked if the government had received any demand from any individual or organisation to bifurcate any State in the country.
The issue of Kongu Naadu began during the reshuffle of the Union Cabinet in July. One of the new inductees into the cabinet was L Murugan, the former state chief of the BJP’s Tamilnadu unit.
When the Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Information Broadcasting was introduced, he was mentioned as hailing from ‘Kongu Naadu’.
Following this, rumours were rife that the Central government was planning to carve out the western belt in Tamilnadu where the BJP has a considerable support base as a separate Union Territory or State.
The ruling DMK, and even some in the AIADMK have already come out in opposition to the idea of bifurcating of Tamilnadu.
However, two weeks after the issue began, Murugan clarified that the mention of Kongu Naadu was a clerical mistake and stated that the BJP has no intention to divide the State and play emotional politics.

Terming her stay as successful, Mamata Banerjee’s first trip to the national capital after her
resounding victory in the West Bengal assembly polls was akin to testing the waters before she
waded deeper into national politics.
“The visit was successful. Met a lot of my colleagues for political reasons. We met for

come here every two months,” said the Chief Minister before leaving TMC MP and nephew Abhishek Banerjee’s residence. She also said that she supports the farmers’ issue and is in touch with them.
She was referring to their protest against three agri laws, which were enacted in September
last year. “There cannot be anything better than opposition unity for a political purpose. I
couldn’t meet every leader that I wanted to because of Covid protocols. However, the outcome
of the meetings has been good. Let us work together,” the TMC supremo said.
She met some leaders of opposition parties, raising speculations about the possible united

They were accompanied by some party Members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assembly. The two leaders were closeted with Shah for about 15 minutes, sources said and added that alliance and other issues were discussed.
Palaniswami, who is also the Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, termed the meeting with Amit Shah as a courtesy call and that no politics was discussed.
He said he had informed Amit Shah on what he discussed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi a day before.
Although both EPS and OPS claimed that they were meeting Modi and Shah for the welfare of Tamilnadu, there were also other factors at work.
According to reports, chief among them was the fear of being targeted by the BJP and the re-emergence of Sasikala, the aide of former Chief Minister and J Jayalalithaa.

Editorial: Australian attention,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/26/editorial-australian-attention/,"July 26, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"Australia has garnered enough international support to defer an attempt by the United Nations’ cultural organisation to downgrade the Great Barrier Reef’s World Heritage status because of damage caused by climate change.
UNESCO had recommended that its World Heritage Committee add the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem off the northeast Australian coast to the World Heritage in Danger list, mainly due to rising ocean temperatures.
Australian-proposed amendments to the draft decision at a committee meeting in China on Friday would have deferred the in danger question until 2023.
But Norway moved amendments that put the reef back on the committee’s agenda at its annual meeting next June. In the meantime, a monitoring mission will visit the reef to determine how the impact of climate change can be managed.
Australian Environment Minister Sussan Ley on Friday told a virtual meeting that downgrading the reef’s status before the committee had finalised its own climate change policy made no sense. Delegates, we ask only two things: time for experts to see first hand our commitment to the reef, its present condition and our management, and for the final climate policy to provide a consistent framework for addressing the impacts of climate change on all World Heritage properties, she said from Australia, where she in in quarantine after lobbying delegates in Europe and the Middle East on the decision.
In 2014, Australia was warned that an in danger listing was being considered rather than being proposed for immediate action. Australia had time to respond by developing a long-term plan to improve the reef’s health called the Reef 2050 Plan. Since then, the reef has suffered significantly from coral bleaching caused by unusually warm ocean temperatures in 2016, 2017 and last year.
The bleaching damaged two thirds of the coral. Australia reacted angrily last month when the draft decision was published to remove the network of 2,500 reefs covering 348,000 sq km (134,000 square miles) from the World Heritage list it joined 40 years ago for its outstanding universal value. The in danger listing is one step away from losing all World Heritage standing. This decision was flawed.
Clearly there were politics behind it, Ley said at the time. Many in Australia’s conservative government saw the move as an attempt to pressure it into committing to reducing the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 and to stop allowing coal mines to be expanded.
In arguing for the reef’s downgrade, UNESCO World Heritage Centre’s marine programme coordinator, Fanny Douvere, referred to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s conclusion that global emissions needed to fall to zero by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
Accelerated action on climate change on all possible levels, in accordance with the 1.5 degree target under the Paris Agreement for Climate Change, and the recovery of the property from poor water quality are both vital and are urgent to secure the outstanding universal value of the Great Barrier Reef for present and for future generations.

WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic urged nations not to think of investigations into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic as political. This is not about politics, it’s not about a blame game, the spokesman said, adding that there was a real requirement for increased collaboration.
“It is about basically a requirement we all have to try to understand how the pathogen came into the human population. In this sense, countries really have the responsibility to work together and to work with WHO in a spirit of partnership,” he stated.
The WHO earlier this month proposed a second phase of studies into the origins of the coronavirus in China, including audits of laboratories and markets in the city of Wuhan, calling for transparency from authorities.
Beijing reacted to the WHO proposal with Zeng Yixin, vice minister of China’s National Health Commission (NHC), telling reporters that the WHO plan disregards common sense and defies science.
Zeng reiterated China’s position that some data could not be completely shared due to privacy concerns. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has also urged Beijing to be transparent and open to cooperate.

"Merkel defends legacy on gender, climate with regrets",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/23/merkel-defends-legacy-on-gender-climate-with-regrets/,"July 23, 2021",Agency,Politics,"Angela Merkel
Berlin: With just months to go before her 16-year leadership of Germany ends, Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday defended her efforts to promote gender equality and curb climate change but expressed regret that some decisions, in hindsight, were made too late.
Merkel has generally resisted commenting on her own record, insisting that it is up to others to assess her legacy. But during a wide-ranging news conference in Berlin, the chancellor spoke frankly about her career and experience as one of the longest-serving democratically elected leaders.
Asked about criticism that she hadn’t been much of a feminist, Merkel, 67, said that while others might have done more, she thinks she contributed to gender equality while in office – and not just because I am female. Still, her initial hopes that voluntary measures would be enough to improve the situation for women in Germany were dashed when reality showed few companies making serious efforts to employ more female executives, she said. Her government eventually drew up legislation requiring large companies to put a minimum number of women on their boards.
I have to honestly say that back in 1990, when I went into politics, I imagined it would be easier, Merkel told reporters.
She added that, over time, she had concluded that promoting women is unthinkable unless there is a change in male behaviour patterns, particularly when it comes to sharing the chores of family and career. Merkel recalled how her minister for families, Ursula von der Leyen was attacked by fellow conservatives more than a decade ago over plans to require fathers to take parental leave for families to qualify for maximum state aid. Von der Leyen is now president of the European Union’s executive commission.
Many new fathers, including those working in her chancellery, have since taken advantage of the system to spend time with their children, Merkel said, adding: It’s wonderful to see how things have changed quite naturally among young families. Merkel also defended her decision to end Germany’s use of nuclear power next year, even if it makes it harder for the country to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the short term.
The decision, made after the Fukushima nuclear disaster 10 years ago, is regarded as one of the pivotal moments of Merkel’s tenure. Critics have said the move places a double burden on Germany as it seeks to cut carbon emissions to ‘net-zero’ by 2045.
There are other countries that choose differently, and in doing so it will be easier for them, in some ways, to achieve climate neutrality, the German leader said. I still believe that in the long term nuclear energy isn’t a sustainable form of energy production. The phase-out of nuclear power by the end of 2022 will make Germany more reliant on coal over the coming years compared to France or Britain. But the German government has also committed to ending the burning of coal by 2038, a goal Merkel said could only be achieved by significantly expanding the use of renewable energy and relying on less-polluting natural gas as a bridge technology.
She rejected the idea that a future government might reverse the nuclear decision, saying that for Germany, the die is cast. She called instead for greater efforts to expand production of hydrogen, a carbon-free fuel that experts say will be needed by the country’s industry.
As Germany’s environment minister in the 1990s, Merkel was instrumental in negotiating the Kyoto Protocol, which sought to impose emissions targets on countries. She acknowledged that the approach failed because many governments refused to sign up and that it wasn’t until the Paris climate accord in 2015 that the current system of voluntary targets gained traction.
I held onto the Kyoto Protocol for a long time, Merkel said. ”That was a mistake, because it wasn’t possible to make it binding internationally. Maybe one should have gone down the path of voluntary commitments faster. Last week’s deadly floods have fueled the debate in Germany over tackling global warming. Experts say such extreme weather will become more frequent and severe as the planet heats up.
We alone can’t save the world’s climate, Merkel said, noting that Germany has already cut its emissions by over 40% compared to 1990 levels. But the way in which we proceed can be an example for others.

Toronto: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Islamophobia has been fed by populism and the politics of division, adding that Canada is witnessing a rise in hatred against Muslims.
There are politicians who have been stoking hatred and division that we as a government have been pushing back against, said Trudeau in an interview with Global News on Monday.
The Canadian government is hosting a national summit on Islamophobia on Thursday.
Canadian Parliament unanimously voted in favour of a motion calling for a national summit on Islamophobia in June, following the attack in London, Ontario, that killed four members of a Muslim family as they were out for an evening walk.
We are seeing a rise in Islamophobia right across the country, said Trudeau in the Global News interview.
Those Edmonton women who were attacked for wearing a hijab weren’t impacted by 21. They’re being impacted by a larger intolerance and hatred and division that is present right across Canada and present right around the world.
Recently, Quebec provincial government passed a bill that bars the wearing of religious symbols by some public service workers in positions of authority, including teachers and police officers while on the job.
Reacting to Quebec’s Bill 21, Trudeau said that while he disagrees with the bill, it is up to the people of Quebec to challenge the legislation in court if they feel it is infringing on their rights.
The federal government isn’t the dad to the provinces. The Constitution lays out areas of jurisdiction where we are watching very closely what happens, says the Prime Minister.

Editorial: Haiti highlight,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/19/editorial-haiti-highlight/,"July 19, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"Haiti’s political future on Sunday grew murkier after the surprise return of first lady Martine Mo se, who was released from a hospital in Miami where she was treated for injuries following an attack in which the president was assassinated.
Martine Mo se did not make any public statements after she descended a private jet wearing a black dress, a black bulletproof vest, a black face mask and her right arm in a black sling as she mourned for President Jovenel Mo se, who was killed July 7 at their private home. Some experts like many in this country of more than 11 million people were surprised at how quickly she reappeared in Haiti and questioned whether she plans to become involved in the country’s politics.
The fact that she returned could suggest she intends to play some role, said Laurent Dubois, a Haiti expert and Duke University professor. She may intervene in one way or another.
Martine Mo se arrived just hours after a prominent group of international diplomats issued a statement that appeared to shun interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, the man currently running the country with the backing of police and the military.
Joseph’s name was never mentioned in the statement made by the Core Group, composed of ambassadors from Germany, Brazil, Canada, Spain, the US, France, the European Union and representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
The group called for the creation of a consensual and inclusive government, adding, To this end, it strongly encourages the designated Prime Minister Ariel Henry to continue the mission entrusted to him to form such a government.
Henry was designated Prime Minister a day before Jovenel Mo se was killed. He did not respond to requests for comment. The UN, OAS and US State Department did not offer further explanation when contacted. Given the current state of Haitian politics, Dubois said he believes the arrival of Martine Mo se could have an impact. She’s obviously in a position to play a role … given how wide open things are, he said, adding that the Core Group’s statement is striking because it makes no reference to Joseph.
One has to wonder whether the developments in the investigation have anything to do with this. They’re all these puzzle pieces that are just changing moment to moment. Right now it seems very hard to figure out how to put these together.
Authorities in Haiti and Colombia say at least 18 suspects directly linked to the killing have been arrested, the majority of them former Colombian soldiers. At least three suspects were killed and police say they are looking for numerous others.
Colombian officials have said that the majority of former soldiers were duped and did not know of the assassination plot. A day after the killing, US State Department spokesman Ned Price had said Joseph was the incumbent in the position and was serving as acting Prime Minister before the assassination: We continue to work with Claude Joseph as such, he said.
The deepening political turmoil has prompted dozens of Haitians to visit the US embassy in Port-au-Prince in recent days to seek a visa or political asylum.

Editorial: Shortcut route,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/06/editorial-shortcut-route/,"July 6, 2021",Agency,Politics,"At the end of May, Chen Pei-jer, a member of an expert committee in Taiwan to evaluate Covid-19 vaccines for use on the island, resigned. Chen’s resignation came after he learned that Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration planned to take a regulatory shortcut in approving two vaccines being developed in Taiwan. The shortcut would allow the shots to be given to people for emergency use before the vaccines have finished the final stage of testing. The proposed shortcut comes as Taiwan scrambles to get vaccines amid its worst outbreak of the pandemic, and has also recorded its first cases of the highly contagious delta variant originally found in India.
Supporters say the shortcut is needed because Taiwan is in a real crunch, and they argue that the move could soon become more common worldwide. That’s because as more vaccines roll out, it’s getting increasingly difficult to conduct the usual tests of a vaccine’s efficacy. But as Chen’s resignation shows, the proposed move has also raised concerns about the risks, chiefly regarding whether people might be given a vaccine that ultimately is shown not to work. This is a shortcut, and this has to do with President Tsai (Ing-wen) we don’t have enough vaccines, and the ruling party is very anxious, said Chen, referring to the president’s remarks in May saying the first batch of domestically made vaccines would be ready in July. Those remarks were viewed by some as putting pressure on regulators before interim data was even analysed.
Tsai has since revised her comments to say July is a goal, and she hopes the first batch will be ready by then. Chen, a member of Taiwan’s Academia Sinica, a top government-backed research institute, said he resigned because he felt politics had interfered with what should be an independent, scientific process. He also felt the proposed shortcut didn’t have enough scientific evidence or global recognition to justify it. Vaccines that are in use globally have gone through a final stage of clinical trials large, carefully designed studies in which the vaccine is given to people who are monitored against a non-vaccinated group to see if the former are more protected from the disease. Taiwan’s shortcut would give emergency-use approval to two vaccines before those studies, although the two shots have gone through first and mid-stage testing just like other vaccines. Instead, the makers would have to demonstrate that the vaccines generate antibodies against Covid-19 at the same level as the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has already been approved for use in Taiwan. There is growing evidence that the level of antibodies in a person’s blood means a certain level of protection from Covd=id-19, but it is not definitive. Taiwanese experts who support the approach say there’s sufficient evidence and urgency as the island battles an ongoing outbreak."

New Delhi: Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has come down heavily on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his tweet questioning vaccine availability in the country.
“Just yesterday, I put out facts on vaccine availability for the month of July. What is Rahul Gandhiji’s problem? Does he not read? Does he not understand? There is no vaccine for the virus of arrogance and ignorance!! Congress must think of a leadership overhaul!” Vardhan said.
An hour earlier, Rahul Gandhi posted this one line in Hindi: “July has come, the vaccine has not arrived.”
Union Minister Piyush Goyal said Rahul Gandhi “should understand that the display of petty politics is not appropriate at this time.”
He further clarified that 120 million Covid-19 vaccine doses will be available in July, which is separate from the supply of private hospitals.

UN envoy sees dire situation in Afghanistan,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/06/23/un-envoy-sees-dire-situation-in-afghanistan/,"June 23, 2021",Agency,Politics,"Deborah Lyons
Kabul: The UN Secretary-General’s special representative for Afghanistan warned on Tuesday that the situation on the ground in the country is dire.
I cannot overstate to the council my concern regarding the present situation in Afghanistan. All of the major trends politics, security, the peace process, the economy, the humanitarian emergency, and Covid — all of these trends are negative or stagnant, Deborah Lyons, the top UN envoy for Afghanistan, told the Security Council in a briefing, Xinhua reported.
If there is a sense of hope, it indeed resides in a fact that previous worse-case predictions did not materialize. But the relentless spirit of the Afghans and their incredible resilience is being severely tested and the possible slide toward dire scenarios is undeniable, she said.
What happens in Afghanistan remains of global consequence and the Security Council needs to be fully informed of the gravity of the present situation, she added.
The mid-April announcement that all international troops will be withdrawn in the coming months sent a seismic tremor through the Afghan political system and society at large. The withdrawal decision was expected. But its speed with the majority of troops now already withdrawn was not. All actors have had to adjust to this new, reality that is unfolding, she said.
The withdrawal is one of four parts of the February 2020 agreement between the US and the Taliban. The agreement generated hope that it would create the space for a peace to be made among Afghans.
The foreign troops would be gone, and therefore, rather than fighting one another, Afghans would have the opportunity to come together and find a path to peace. But instead, actions on the battlefield have been far greater than progress at the negotiating table, said Lyons.

She said that she will ‘come soon and set the party straight’. The latest clip emerged a day after the AIADMK headed by Panneerselvam and former CM Edappadi K Palaniswami sacked 15 people she spoke with recently.
“Other elections are coming up. We have to win and protect Jayalalithaa’s legacy. I am pained that party workers are expelled when we are in opposition,” she is heard saying.
“I have a responsibility. I am confident that I would be able to set the party straight. My wish is that the AIADMK should be strong even if it turns 100 years. We would definitely bring Amma rule. I will meet all of you soon,” she added.
During telephonic talk with many others, she said she decided to step aside from politics in March as “they had felt that they could accomplish victory in the Assembly election on their own.” The AIADMK regime could have retained power had “they cooperated and heeded to her call for unity,” Sasikala added.

The resolution moved by former Chief Minister and AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and seconded by joint coordinator and former CM Edappadi K Palaniswami, while making it clear that there was no place for Sasikala, who was the close-aide of late leader J Jayalalithaa in the AIADMK, also sent out a message all is well within in the party and there was no differences between them.
Recalling Sasikala’s statement ahead of the Assembly polls that she has decided to keep away from politics, it said she had been enacting a drama by daily releasing audio clips in TV channels, hinting her return to politics and claiming to capture the party to gain political prominence following the AIADMK’s performance in the elections’.
Stating that the AIADMK, which had grown due to the sacrifices made by two great leaders (founder MGR and J Jayalalithaa) will remain in history as a massive people’s movement and will not destroy itself for the whims and fancies of one family, it said.
Recalling the joint statement issued by them last month warning of stringent action against those violating party discipline, the two leaders said all those who were in touch with Sasikala in the series of audio clips will face disciplinary action for violating party discipline and for acting in a manner that brought disrepute to the party.
Soon after the meeting adopted a resolution, the two leaders issued a joint statement expelling party spokesman V Pugalendhi and 15 others, including former Minister M Anandan and former MP V K Chinnasamy from the primary membership of the party.
They said these party members, representing various districts, were expelled from the party from today onwards and urged the AIADMK cadres not to have any links with them.
In another release, the two leaders also expelled Theni district functionary AKM Azhagarsamy from the party for alleging putting out posters against Palaniswami and hailing Panneerselvam, triggering rumours of some differences between OPS and EPS.
However, by expelling him, the two leaders cleared the air that all is well between them.

The series faced however, faced the ire of certain sections before release, over allegations that it depicted Tamils in an objectionable manner. The actor feels the series has worked, and that proves people know the story isn’t about hurting sentiments.
We as a team — our directors, writers — are very sentimental to each and every person and state. We are sensitive to the culture. We would never do anything to offend anyone. Even in the first season, and in this season of ‘The Family Man’, we don’t talk about politics. We put the characters there and we look at those characters in a humanised way. All those characters are heroes of their own story. Now, the show is there right in front of you. I know you are liking it because somewhere you feel that the show is not at all what you were apprehensive about. It is talking about you and your sentiment in a very respectful manner with all the love, Bajpayee said.
Controversy erupted when Tamil Nadu Minister for Information Technology, Mano Thangaraj, had written a letter to the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Prakash Javedkar, on May 24, calling for a ban of the web series.
In his letter, Thangaraj said that the series had depicted the Eelam Tamils in a highly objectionable manner and that if allowed to stream it would be prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony in the state.
The Family Man 2 has Samantha Akkineni in her debut Hindi role, as a Sri Lankan Tamil suicide bomber named Raji, and also brings back Priyamani, Sharib Hashmi and Sharad Kelkar in familiar roles.
On pre-release expectations, Bajpayee said: You don’t expect the extent of response. You are confident that people will like it but to what extent they will like it is unpredictable. It has taken us by surprise and we are overwhelmed with the response. The show is going to be there forever and I have read that many people are watching it a second time.

"Expert shares views on rising price of petrol, diesel",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/06/14/expert-shares-views-on-rising-price-of-petrol-diesel/,"June 14, 2021",NT Bureau,Politics,"Vijaykumar Jayaram
Chennai: Millions keep pondering on why is the fuel price high in India when compared to other nations. This means such people have already done the currency value conversions of on the comparative nations. But have they taken into consideration the time value of money, asks professor Vijaykumar Jayaram (VKJ).
Speaking to ‘News Today’, VKJ, says, “Let’s see a Google search return. In the year 1947 as the news media reported on the departure of British from free India, these were the commodity prices in Rs. – Petrol per litre cost 0.27 and milk cost 0.12. This means petrol was two and quarter times more than milk. What is it now in 2021? Even today petrol is 2.25 times that of quality milk! So why are most men in India always complaining about fuel price hike? Women, some of whom are good drivers have lesser complaints, in fact nowadays only men complain about the price hikes on the other hand women complain about the quality of materials and services. Let’s encourage all readers to do a little more research, a sort of Quick and Daring Analysis – a QDA is what I would call it.”
He adds, “A cinema ticket in 1947 cost Rs. 0.30 and a flight from Delhi to Mumbai cost Rs. 140 (this was more than the price of gold). Now, just compare the last 73 years price of goods and services to what is the price fluctuations happening now, look for the ratio and proportions and you will find more similarities than differences. Rather jokingly quip – we as a nation have not changed much?”
“We Indians, all have the same cribbing complaining attitudes, I mean look at the
incredible Japanese, after WW2 they gave a run even to the American supremacy in terms of quality in manufacturing. Well today Indian has see CW2 (Covid wave 2) and with a badly bruised economy almost akin to a war torn zone we are still complaining.”
“It is high time we learn to build a constructive opposition. It is high time all Indians learn some basic economics, politics and fundamentals of mass psychology. Now comes the last the final question – If fuel is the basic need of all Indians, why is the government levying so much taxes? (even after Independence). Simple answer – with 85 per cent fuel being imported neither the opposition (when in power) or the current government has any choice. The only solution to this is – Increase E-vehicles and a quick term solution would be is for India to do an international backward integration with respect to oil sourcing. This means we buy out or collaborate in manufacturing oil outside India. Seriously that is the best solution.”
After all with amount fuel pollution we Indians do not only in Delhi, but in other parts of our Bharath, we shouldn’t mind the taxes on fuel. I mean to me all the political party leaders hungamma on the fuel price hike, crying hoarse that this will affect vegetable prices and even other prices, I have one question – have these mahanubhavas ever studied what is everyday low pricing (EDLP)? In the past, when the prices of tomatoes or onions or gold sky rocketed, even without a fuel price hike, where were these protestors? What are their explanations? Surely tomatoes or onions have a Rs. 2 to Rs. 6 price fluctuation, don’t they? Now the same applies to fuel in a free market, he adds.
“Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan once explained about Samuelson-Balassa effect as a student questioned when all prices were falling, why is Dosa cost going up and not coming down? I don’t how many understood or did the message not reach the masses?”
Last but not the least bringing the fuel price under GST is technically not feasible but not impossible. My point is it will not give a permanent solution to the curse of fossil fuel prices. The best we Indians can do is gradually move into a better attitude of accepting theeconomics as we experience. Last but not the least adopt electric vehicles and or still best increase our share in fuel production around the globe. Our desi fuel scientists are already working on certain models that will help us collaborate or share Oil manufacturing capabilities in the middle east, he winds up.

Reacting to reports that some members from a group of 23 ‘dissident’ leaders who wrote to Sonia Gandhi calling for sweeping reforms would join the BJP, Kapil Sibal, a prominent member of this club, emphatically ruled out a similar move, declaring it would be ‘Over my dead body’.
He said, “I don’t want to comment on what the party leadership has done or not done. We have reached a stage in Indian politics where decisions of this nature are not based on ideology at all. They are based on what I now call ‘Prasada Ram politics’. Earlier it was Aaya Ram Gaya Ram. We have seen this happening in West Bengal – suddenly people leave because they think BJP is going to succeed…You want to fight elections not on the basis of your convictions towards an ideology but your conviction that ‘I might get something personally’. The same happened in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra…”
Sibal took a dig at former Union Minister Jitin Prasada, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday.
Taking to Twitter, Sibal wondered if Prasada is just a ‘catch’ for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

Talking to reporters after holding a meeting with party district Secretaries here Friday, he said Sasikala, who is the close-aide of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, had already issued a statement before the Assembly polls that she was keeping away from politics.
Asked about the recent audio featuring Sasikala in which she said she would set right the AIADMK and guide it on the path shown by late leaders MGR and Jayalalithaa, he said Sasikala was not in the AIADMK.
On Sasikala hinting of her returning to active politics in the leaked audio conversations which went viral on the social media, Palaniswami said she (Sasikala) has been talking only to the AMMK, formed by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran and not with the AIADMK.
“The audio has been released in an attampt to create a confusion in the AIADMK which has emerged as the strongest opposition (after the April six Assembly polls)…it will not happen,” he added.
The views of the AIADMK cadres was that Ms Sasikala should not be in the party.
Asked about AIADMK Coordinator O Panneerselvam not present in today’s meeting, Palaniswami denied any rift between them and said he (OPS) is busy in shifting to his new house.
“Today being an auspicious day, I came to the party office,” he said, on his first visit to the party office after becoming the Leader of the Opposition.
In the audio clip, Sasikala has dropped enough hints of returning to active politics after the Covid pandemic, at a time when AIADMK had lost power in the recent polls.
In a phone conversation with one of the party cadres, which has gone viral on social media, Sasikala was heard confirming her plans of her return in the politics.
“Do not worry, surely will sort out the party things. All be brave ok. Once corona pandemic is over, I will come,” Sasikala is heard telling the cadre during the phone call.

“We will make a decision shortly and come soon. Don’t worry. It hurts to see them fight. We made this party grow with a lot of difficulties so I cannot just watch it go to waste. Very soon I will come. Once corona is over, I will meet everyone,” she had said.

Chennai: Tamilnadu’s Finance Minister Palanivel Thiagarajan is making waves not just in the state, but also in the national and global arena, thanks to his connections and concern.
While the former is expected to bring vaccines to the State from the US, the latter has made him bat for Tamilnadu’s rights at the recent meet of GST Council.
Son of DMK veteran PTR Palanivel Rajan, Palanivel Thiagarajan occupied top positions at Lehman Brothers and Standard Chartered Bank before he entered active politics.
Recently, he reached out to US civil rights leader Jesse Jackson (Sr) to help ensure that at least 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the excess reserves in the US are shipped to India at the earliest.
In an appeal to Jackson on the direction of Chief Minister M K Stalin, Palanivel Thiagarajan held a Zoom call meeting and urged Jackson to request US President Joe Biden to expeditiously release an allotment of AstraZeneca vaccines for India (including a portion earmarked to Tamilnadu) from the 80 million vaccines that the US has offered to donate to foreign countries.
After the meeting, Jesse Jackson Sr., conveyed a personal message to the Chief Minister: “Help is on the way. We stand by you. Keep hope alive. We will do our best to ensure that the state of Tamilnadu gets its due share of covid vaccines soon.”
And, on Friday, PTR in his maiden speech at the 43rd GST Council meeting chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, gave a detailed account on the shortcomings in the Council and the financial policies of the Central government that have been affecting the Tamilnadu government.
He reiterated the demand of Tamilnadu government for levying zero-rating GST for essential Corona medicines at least for a temporary period since this would ensure the cost of the medicines without the suppliers having to absorb any reversal of input tax credit.
Rajan called upon the GST Council “to consider making arrangements for fully compensating the state for the gap arising in 2021-22 between the protected revenue and the actual expected revenue either by means of ‘bridge funding by the government or by open market debt arrangement”.
Palanivel Thiagarajan’s acts have fetched him huge fan following on social media, with many hailing him as the champion of State’s rights.

Biden told US intelligence officials to redouble their efforts to investigate the origins of the pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese laboratory.
After months of minimising that possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is joining worldwide pressure on China to be more open about the outbreak, aiming to head off Republican complaints the President has not been tough enough to press China on alleged obstruction.
Zhao also said the US must open itself up to investigations into its biological laboratories, including at the military’s Fort Detrick base. The US side claims that it wants China to participate in a comprehensive, transparent, evidence-based international investigation, Zhao said.
We would like to ask the US side to do the same as China and immediately cooperate with the World Health Organisation on origin tracing research in a scientific manner.

IIT-Guwahati researchers develop technology by using concept of chemically patterned SLIP,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/12/10/iit-guwahati-researchers-develop-technology-by-using-concept-of-chemically-patterned-slip/,"December 10, 2020",NT Bureau,Technology,"Chennai: Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati have developed a new technology to harvest water from the air by using the concept of hydrophobicity.
Uttam Manna, Associate Professor of Chemistry, along with his research scholars Kousik Maji, Avijit Das and Manideepa Dhar, published the results of the ‘path-breaking’ work in the journal of Royal Society of Chemistry, IIT-Guwahati said in a release.
According to Manna, “Such water-harvesting techniques use the concept of hydrophobicity or water-repelling nature of some materials. The concept of hydrophobicity can be understood by looking at the lotus leaf.”
The research team has used the concept of chemically patterned SLIPS for the first time, to effectively harvest water from moist air, he added.
According to a statement, “A patterned hydrophilic SLIP was produced by spraying a sponge-like porous polymeric material on top of a simple A4 printer paper. Further, chemically modulated hydrophilic spots were associated on the coating, prior to lubricating with two distinct types of oils. This surface could harvest water from foggy/water vapour laden air without the need for any cooling arrangement.”
“With increasing water scarcity throughout the world, there have been attempts to collect and conserve water through non-traditional means and the IIT-Guwahati scientists have turned to nature to design ways of water harvesting,” it stated.
“We have produced a highly efficient water harvesting interface. The researchers have also compared the performance of their pitcher-plant inspired SLIPS materials to other bio- inspired ideas and have found theirs to be superior in terms of efficiency of water harvesting,” said Manna.

Investing in international companies becomes easy with technology,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/12/05/investing-in-international-companies-becomes-easy-with-technology/,"December 5, 2020",NT Bureau,Technology,"Chennai: Investing in top international companies is now possible, thanks to the easy access to them via international mutual funds that are available on personal finance apps.
A statement here said, “International Funds are one of the simplest and low-cost options for Indians wanting to invest in the international markets. These funds are offered by Indian mutual fund houses and work like other domestic mutual funds wherein you invest in rupees and get the redemption amount also in rupees”. So why invest in other countries at all?
According to ETMoney, an investor focused only on the domestic stock market would have his/ her investments prone to country-specific risks such as an economic slowdown or political instability. Diversifying your investments by investing in markets of other countries gives you a safety net. Another big reason is that India’s share in the global economy varies from 3-8 per cent, and investing in international markets makes you a part of the growth of the remaining 92-97 per cent of the world.
It is here that personal finance apps come into play. You can easily select your favourite international mutual funds from top Indian fund houses such as Edelweiss, ICICI, Axis, UTI, SBI, Motilal Oswal, etc based on country and sector and start with SIPs as low as Rs 500 or lump-sum investments from as low as Rs 5,000.

"Speaking at UN, India lauds role of technology in handling Covid-19",https://newstodaynet.com/2020/06/16/speaking-at-un-india-lauds-role-of-technology-in-handling-covid-19/,"June 16, 2020",NT Bureau,Technology,"Nagaraj Naidu
Chennai: India has heaped praises on the role of technology in helping the country handle the coronavirus pandemic, and said the expedited development of a contact tracing mobile application and artificial intelligence-based testing kits enabled the country’s efforts.
Speaking at a virtual high-level debate on the Impact of Rapid Technological Change on the Sustainable Development Goals and Targets, India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Nagaraj Naidu, said new technologies like drones and tracing apps became more acceptable during the COVID-19 pandemic than they were before.
He spoke about the Aarogya Setu mobile app, launched by the Indian government on 2 April to help people assess their risk of getting infected with coronavirus and alert authorities if they have come in close contact with an infected person.
“New technologies offer incredible promise: from increasing the productivity of systems while lowering emissions and waste; to enhancing food security and efficiency of global supply chains, or breakthrough discoveries in areas like new medicines, or new materials,’ he said and added: ‘We have to remember that once a new technology rolls over you, if you’re not part of the steamroller, you are part of the flattened road.”
Speaking on the occasion, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against the ungoverned use of digital technology. “Digital technology is central to almost every aspect of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, from vaccine research to online learning models, e-commerce and tools that are enabling hundreds of millions of people to work and study from home.”
At the same time, he said, Covid-19 has provided dramatic evidence of the threats posed by the ungoverned use of digital technology, from exclusion and inequality, to surveillance, human rights abuses and cybercrime.
“The pandemic has ushered in some of the most intrusive surveillance technologies we have ever seen, together with a significant increase in cynical ransomware attacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities. Meanwhile, the danger of digital fragmentation is increasing, exacerbated by geopolitical divides, technological competition and polarisation,” he said.

"Apple, Google release smartphone technology for apps",https://newstodaynet.com/2020/05/22/apple-google-release-smartphone-technology-for-apps/,"May 22, 2020",Agency,Technology,"Washington: Apple and Google have released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.
The companies said 22 countries and several US States are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.
Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven’t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.
Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants’ privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.
The companies said they’re not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic exposure notification system can augment that process and slow the spread of Covid-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren’t yet showing symptoms.
The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.
User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps, the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.
The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.
“We invite other States to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running”, said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.
North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about four per cent of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.
Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota’s app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps his model, to help public health workers track where Covid-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.

"Emirates VP speaks on airlines’ new plans, market trends and technology",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/08/20/emirates-vp-speaks-on-airlines-new-plans-market-trends-and-technology/,"August 20, 2019",Praveen Kumar S,Technology,"Chennai, Aug 20: The airline industry in India for a long time has been floating on murky waters. However, Emirates continues to fly high. In February, the Dubai-based airways announced a commitment for 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s worth $21.4 billion at list prices in an agreement signed with Airbus, to be delivered from 2021 and 2024.
The airline will also receive 14 more A380 deliveries from 2019 until the end of 2021. In an exclusive interview to News Today, vice-president of Emirates (India & Nepal) Essa Sulaiman Ahmad speaks on the airlines’ new plans, market trends and technology.
Excerpts from the interview
Q: Can you explain why the new Skywards Gold offer was given to Silver and Blue members?
A: People spending on air travel has grown at a compounded rate of 24 per cent over the past three years. More than half of the $ 36 billion spent by Indians on transport in 2018 was on airfare. At Emirates, our aim is to always keep innovating and enhancing the flying experience. The Emirates Skywards Gold membership has amazing benefits from complimentary business class lounge access for member and one guest, priority baggage, unlimited Wi-Fi, complimentary seat selection and more.
Q: How has India as a market been for Emirates this past and current year?
A: Emirates has progressively grown its Indian network to over 170 weekly flights across nine destinations. As a long-term strategic partner for India, Emirates is committed to future investment and expansion in the market in support of India’s 2020 growth target of 85 million international passengers a year, and to assist India in its goal to be the world’s third largest aviation market by 2020.
Q: How does the management look at the current scenario in Indian airline space?
A: India has been an integral part of Emirates’ route network since the airline was first launched in 1985. With robust competitive dynamics at play, and with demand outstripping supply in many Indian cities, the market would benefit from easing of the bilateral capacity restrictions between India and Dubai. Renewed arrangements would help bolster significant bilateral trade relationship between India and Dubai.
Q: What is the next best innovation that you predict will revolutionise the segment?
A: Emirates has been at the forefront of innovation in the industry. We were the first to instal TV screens in every seat on every aircraft in its fleet; the first airline to allow mobile telephony in-flight; the first airline to introduce web virtual reality tech on its digital platform. Today, the airline provides one of the most comprehensive and state-of-the-art entertainment and connectivity services in the skies.
Q: With uncertainties in fossil fuel industry and onslaught of new propulsion systems, how do you think the airline industry will shape up in the near future?
A: We are committed to minimising the environmental impact of our operations across all our businesses and activities. We minimise impact by investing in a multi-billion-dollar fleet – one of the youngest in the skies and hosts state-of-the-art technology, reducing fuel use, noise and emissions. Last year, we created a permanent Operations Efficiency Steering Group that set stakeholder targets and implemented several initiatives, including the monitoring, reporting and verification of fuel-saving initiatives. We leveraged data and analytics to optimise fuel quantities on every flight.
Q: Could you tell us your revenue, growth rate for the past year and expectations for the current year?
A: Emirates reported a profit of $ 237 million, for the financial year ended 31 March 2019, 69 per cent down from the previous year, and the group posted a profit of $ 631 million for the financial year ended 31 March 2019, down 44 per cent from last year. Its revenue increased by 6 per cent to $ 26.7 billion, supported by steady passenger and cargo performance. In 2018-19, the group collectively invested $ 3.9 billion in new aircraft and equipment, acquisition of companies, modern facilities, latest technologies, and staff initiatives, a significant increase over last year’s investment spend of $ 2.5 billion. It’s hard to predict the year ahead, but Emirates is well-positioned to navigate speed bumps, as well as to compete and succeed in the global marketplace."

A look at technology that helps face water crisis,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/06/19/a-look-at-technology-that-helps-face-water-crisis/,"June 19, 2019",NT Bureau,Technology,"Chennai: With severe water crisis plaguing the city for the past several weeks, residents are left facing dire situations. Some are forced to chase Metrowater tankers for their daily needs. Solutions are being sort after to over come this major issue.
In this article, News Today complies a list of prominent solutions that have always favoured citizens.
Rooftop solution
The rainwater harvesting method has provided a solution that can be practiced easily in every household.
It is a simple model where the roof acting as a catchment for rainfall, which after flowing through a series of filters and pipes is stored in ground-level containers for direct use or recharged into ground water.
Cementing hope
Ferro-cement Tanks is a low cost alternative for expensive water harvesting containers made of masonry, plastic and RCC. It has proved highly effective in high rainfall regions where large amount of water need to be stored in clean form.
These tanks require materials like sand, cement, mild steel bar and galvanized iron wire mesh. They can be easily constructed. It’s light in weight and can be moulded into any shape required.
It is believed to last for around 25 years with little maintenance. It can be appropriate for use in Indian villages and disaster prone areas as its fireproof and tough.
Peddling water
Cycle run water pumps are a saver of time and cost of electricity and fuel, this technology utilizes human power generated by pedalling a bicycle to lift water from streams, ponds, canals and wells.
When cycle is pedalled, it creates an up and down motion of pistons which pressurizes water flow to outlet. A portable model which can be installed on site has also been developed.
Designed for small scale farmers who don’t have capacity to afford costly diesel rum motors, this arrangement can bring a flow of 100 litres per minute. The complete unit is made of cast iron and aluminium.
Syringe
Most of the open wells and tube wells in coastal areas contain salty water due to seepage of sea water.
Rainwater harvesting is a viable option for solving the issue of drinking water, but construction of rainwater overhead tanks is unaffordable for marginal farmers.
According to media reports, Antoji in Kerala has innovated a cost effective method for harvesting rainwater in coastal areas. Rainwater is collected from the roof tops of houses and stored in a pressure tank on the ground and with the help of PVC pipes, water is lowered below sea level (16-24 feet).
The water is retained in the underground water column which is then harvested during summer by a simple piston pump or motor by constructing a tube well in the vicinity. It has proved successful in diluting recharging ground water in coastal areas of Kerala, and Antoji has installed 150 tanks in different parts of Kerala.
Wheels up
Water wheel comes from a foreign visitor who was inspired by women from villages of Rajasthan, who carried round earthen matkas on head for long distances in hot weather.
This invention has made carrying water not only an effortless but fun activity. It is a round wheel shaped storage tanker with an attached handle on top to provide painless mobility.
It has already become popular in villages of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Designed to reduce the drudgery and save time of working women, water wheel can store upto 10 to 50 litres of water in hygienic conditions. It’s designed for lasting on rough terrains and made from high quality plastic."

At the event, the firm also announced that its Helio chip P90 would be rolled out globally “very soon”.
MediaTek representatives also assured that Digital India plans would definitely help them in taking AI and 5G plans one step closer to reality very soon."
New technology adopted to compensate rising weight of cars,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/14/new-technology-adopted-to-compensate-rising-weight-of-cars/,"May 14, 2019",Praveen Kumar S,Technology,"During the early days when cars where light, they didn’t need more power to help them accelerate or go around corners. It was this lightness that helped manufacturers get away with offering single pot pistons and smaller brake calipers to stop the car. For example, the Alpine A110 that everybody hail to be the lightest and purest sports car of the decade is nearly 300 kg heavier than its predecessor. What we call light now, isn’t light at all to be frank.
Blame it on the nanny limiters, regulators and India’s nature to follow the western world without any use of the part in the head called the brain. Yes, the Alpine is not on sale in India, but the problem is too many safety features add more weight and that spoils everything.
I am not saying safety is bad. No, I think the opposite of it. But bringing in automatic rain sensing wipers, auto headlamps, lane departure assist, parking assist, cruise control and the whole host of other features deem humans as unworthy of driving. I do not know when people got it into their minds that driving is dangerous. Just because one might fall down and die while walking, people do not refrain from getting out of their bed, do they?
I am way off topic here. What I came to say is that adding excessive weight in the name of safety has made cars heavier and that means bigger brakes (which are heavier too) are needed. But here is the catch, more weight means cars will not give more economy and will produce more emissions. So what do carmakers do? They reduce weight by using alloys, try different manufacturing methods and even different components altogether.
Recently, Bugatti, the makers of one of the fastest cars in the world, tested brake calipers that were made using 3D printing tech. The material in question was titanium and Bugatti’s website claims that the caliper is the biggest ever to be manufactured to date.
Further, the carmaker, if they deem their manufacturing process to be worthy and safe, will pass it on to the Volkswagen group, which it is a part of.
Think about it, Bugatti makes cars that 200 mph for breakfast and if they can manufacture titanium brake calipers using 3D printing, what more can be done? The brake pads? or the discs themselves?
For those who do not know, 3D printing is a computerised process from which a component can be made from a single block of material. There is no cutting or welding here, just a single piece of metal or material that would not lose its properties and retain its strength, something manufacturers have spent millions to find out. With Bugatti testing it and they say the plan is to use it in a series production car this year, the car industry is in for a revolutionary change in testing times, yet again.
What this would mean is that bigger brakes need not be heavier and that means more stopping power without any disadvantages. Although I am still against romping in more weight in the name of ‘added’ safety. This would also lead to a whole host of components that can be 3D printed. Think about suspension arms, brackets that hold err…things, nuts and bolts, bushings, centre consoles, the entire dashboard and maybe wheels themselves.
But with all that comes the problem for traditional parts makers who will be hit. But, dare I say it, they need to overhaul their method of thinking if they want to survive, because cars are going to get heavier still and carmakers would want light and strong parts to compensate the extra flab. I am not sure about how affordable the components will be. I just hope it is not the case of top-down practice of a family tree. Want a 3D printed gearknob anyone?"

The technology behind clutchless motorbikes,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/03/19/the-technology-behind-clutchless-motorbikes/,"March 19, 2019",S Ben Raja,Technology,"If you were looking to buy a motorbike or a scooter in early 2000s, you had an unique offering in the market. They were the then Hero Honda Street 100 and TVS Jive, India’s only geared motorbikes without clutch levers. They were breakthrough products but aren’t on sale anymore.
Why were they unique?
These clutch-less motorbikes were different because they reportedly had three technologies incorporated for transforming a normal geared motorcycle with a clutch lever into a semi-automatic model. The technologies includes rotary gear system, centrifugal clutch and integration of clutch cable with gear lever. The three tech work in tandem to help a rider to completely avoid using a clutch lever which has turned out to be the prime cause of tension and unintentional halts while riding a usual manual transmission motorcycle.
Rotary gear system
The rotary gear system in motorcycles without clutch levers help in seamless slotting. For example, in a normal geared motorcycle, we can go from neutral to the top gear but have to return back to neutral. But, in a rotary gear system, we can literally circle around with the gears. That is we can go from neutral to the top gear and vice versa any number of times in the same direction. In a normal motorcycle, if we are stuck in traffic in fourth gear and want to come to first, we have to engage gears backwards one by one. But, in a rotary gear system, we can just press the lever two times in the front and go from fourth to first via the neutral.
Centrifugal clutch
The centrifugal clutches in these motorcycles prevent them from stalling in heavy traffic. In a normal motorcycle, if the engine rpm and wheel rpm with all gear ratios in place don’t match, then the engine knocks and stalls if we don’t press the clutch lever on time. But, if a centrifugal clutch is in place, it automatically disengages in the engine from the gearbox if the engine rpm goes below a threshold limit, say 1,000 rpm. So, a motorcycle with a centrifugal clutch never halts in traffic.
Integration of clutch cable
In a normal geared motorcycle, the gear and clutch lever are separate and need to be operated individually. But, in motorcycles without clutch levers, the clutch cable is attached with the gear lever itself. So, while changing gears, all we need to do is go ahead and slot them. When we press the gear lever, the clutch automatically actuates, disengages the engine for seamless shifting. When we remove our foot from the lever, the clutch again engages the engine and gearbox.
So, in the end, with these three technologies, we can ride a geared motorcycle like an automatic scooter but without losing the essence of a motorcycle; its high performance and fuel efficiency. Street was launched in 2000s when petrol was cheap. Also when TVS launched the Jive in the 2010s, it was a sales success for many months but later the brand failed to update the product to keep it fresh. Nevertheless, even today there are thousands of Streets and Jives on our roads."

Space technology has entered every household: Union Minister,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/01/18/space-technology-has-entered-every-household-union-minister/,"January 18, 2019",NT Bureau,Technology,"Jitendra Singh
Bengaluru: Union Minister for State for Space, Jitendra Singh said on Thursday a technology in border management has been developed in India and it can virtually enter inside the houses across the border of Pakistan.
Taking part in an event organised by Indian Space Research Organisation called UNNATI (UNispace Nanosatellite Assembly and Training), the Union Minister said he was amazed that a technology in the integrated comprehensive border management has been started in India. It is a pioneer project started in the international border of Pakistan.
The union minister signified the importance of space technology. It is used in infrastructure works, construction of roads, intersection of Railway network, manning of railway lines and disaster management.
In a statement, ISRO said that UNNATI is a capacity building programme on nanosatellite development and has been planned for three years in three batches. It would benefit 90 delegates from 45 countries. The first batch of UNNATI began on Thursday with 30 participants from 17 countries.
ISRO chief K Sivan addressing the media said the intention of the program is to see that technology benefits the neighbouring countries and learn the lessons India learnt while building the satellites.
The programme will comprise theoretical course work on nanosatellite definition, utility, laws governing their impact on space debris, design drivers, reliability and quality assurance and hands-on training on assembly, integration and testing of nanosatellites, added the statement issued by ISRO."
"New mobile, instant technology to help diagnose viral infections",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/01/14/new-mobile-instant-technology-to-help-diagnose-viral-infections/,"January 14, 2019",PTI,Technology,"London: Scientists have developed a new miniature, portable gene sequencing technology that can diagnose infection from viruses such as Ebola or Zika almost instantly in the field. Diagnosis is both quick and early, which avoids the need to transfer contaminated samples, researchers said.
“The technology is characterised by the production of long nucleotide sequences, which makes it possible to sequence the entire viral genome,” said Philippe Roumagnac, a virologist at The French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD).
CIRAD was one of the first laboratories in the world to test and validate its use in plant virology, researchers said.
“Using a diseased yam plant, it took us just a few hours to sequence the entire genome of two single-strand RNA viruses, a macluravirus and a potyvirus,” said Denis Filloux from CIRAD.
As with human virology, the fact that the technology has now been validated in a plant virology laboratory paves the way for real-time, mobile detection of chronic, seasonal or emerging plant viruses, even in isolated areas, researchers said.
By shortening the time that elapses between sampling and diagnosis, the technology will help detect harmful organisms at an earlier stage, they said."
MSME Ministry to set up 20 technology centres,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/12/20/msme-ministry-to-set-up-20-technology-centres/,"December 20, 2018",NT Bureau,Technology,"Chennai: The government will set up 20 additional technology centres to help Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Union Minister Giriraj Singh has said.
These centres support MSMEs by giving them access to advanced manufacturing technologies, skilling manpower and providing technical and business advisory support. “We have got sanction to set up 20 more technology centres in different parts of the country,” he said.
Currently, 10 such centres are operational in different States of the country.
The MSME Minister said there were some challenges for the sector, but the government was working on all those areas, including providing timely credit.
He added that schemes like Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) and credit guarantee fund trust for micro and small enterprises had helped in creating 19 lakh new entrepreneurs."
Tamil cinema and technology always go hand-in-hand,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/11/30/tamil-cinema-and-technology-always-go-hand-in-hand/,"November 30, 2018",Santhosh Mathevan,Technology,"What brings difference to a novel, a stage play or a movie is the medium and its attributes through which the story is conveyed – put simply, it is technology. This very tool helped filmmakers to magnify their imaginary plots. Technology is the pivotal factor that makes ‘film-language’ evolve.
In earlier days, the stories and characters were quite ‘distant’ from the spectators who could just enjoy watching a movie when a superstar like MKT speaks in a completely outlandish ‘Manipravala’ language.
As days rolled by and cinema started to evolve, the stories became life-like. Today, the characters that were once distant, come close to the viewer figuratively – in a relatable storyline – and literally – through technology like 3D.
Yesterday, Shankar’s 2.0 has marked one more milestone in terms of introducing a technology to the rest of the world’s film fraternity – SRL 4D Sound System. What was a nightmare for major sound designing companies like Dolby, has now become a reality, that, too, in Kollywood.
Until two days back, sounds of any movie in a cinema hall could be heard from three sides (left, right and top). Here’s 2.0 that brings you sound from all sides, and puts you in the middle of the movie. You have speakers below your seat and you’ll feel like you are part of 2.0, with this SRL tech (left, right, top and bottom).
Guess what? SRL stands for Shankar, Resul and Lyca – respectively, the filmmaker, the sound designer and production house of this magnum opus.
Here is a list of first movies that had various technology upgrades in different phases of Tamil cinema.
Full-length colour film – Alibabvum 40 Thirudargalum (1956)
Colour screen was once meant for only big-budget films. In this era, when a complete colour feature film could be made out of a high-definition mobile camera, it is really significant to know about Alibabvum 40 Thirudargalum, when people saw how fair M G Ramachandran actually was. After that  people of his complexion were usually referred to as, ‘MGR maathiri thaga thaga nu minnuringa’.
Eastman Colour – Kadhalikka Neramillai (1964)
Directed by Sridhar, Kadhilikka Nermallai was Tamil cinema’s first Eastman Colour film.
A romantic comedy, the film featured an ensemble cast consisting of T S Balaiah, R Muthuraman, Nagesh, Rajasree, Sachu, Ravichandran and Kanchana. The latter two made their debut in Tamil cinema with
this film.
CinemaScope – Raja Raja Cholan (1973)
If it was a colour film for MGR, it was CinemaScope for his industry rival Sivaji Ganesan. Raja Raja Cholan was the first movie to be projected with CinemaScope tech.
The images projected out would be two-and-a-half times wide to its height. So, that’s how Thanjai Periya Kovil in the film was actually magnificent on the screen as well.
3D – Annai Bhoomi (1985)
When 3D technology was initially preferred to make fantasy films across the globe, the Tamil industry went the other way. This one starring Vijayakanth, Annai Bhoomi, was an action-comedy that still had a lot of space for making a never-seen-before experience for Tamil audience.
Stereo sound – Kuruthipunal (1995)
There is a scene in Kuruthipunal when Adhi (Kamal) tries to trace the place where his colleague Abbas (Arjun) has been kidnapped and hidden. This very scene was the first one to give the audience an experience of the difference between left and right sounds that originate from the screen. It was all possible because of stereo tech.
DTS – Karuppu Roja (1996)
This is one level above stereo when the entire sound of a movie was made digital to yield better clarity. This Ramki-starrer movie’s director Aabaavaanan is well-known for adapting different technologies. Remember Oomai Vizhigal, when CinemaScope was rebooted in Tamil cinema? That was made by the same crew.
Time-freeze – Boys (2003)
When we make a list of movies that introduced groundbreaking technology to cinema, this director’s movie – Boys – will definitely have a place in that. When filmmaker Shankar decided to show all sides of love in a duet song, he opted to freeze time and captured an entire panorama of the environment where his lead pair shakes a leg for a melody number. As many as 62 cameras were used to capture every shot of this song so that audience could witness the romance of Siddharth and Genelia from every direction.
Nero Motion Camera – Thillalangadi (2010)
This is yet another duet to have a completely new age capturing technology. This motion camera can re-frame over 360 degrees. So, the entire song was captured in a green-mat space in a single shot and showed multiples of Jayam Ravi and Tamannah in one stretch.
Performance Capture – Maatraan (2012)
When two Suriyas wanted to be conjoined onscreen in Maatraan, it would not have been possible to make it in the usual green-mat filming procedure. So, this K V Anand directorial venture opted for Performance Capture technology, when a double was employed in place of one of the twins and the actor’s facial expressions alone were morphed over the dupe’s face.
An upgraded version of this technology was used for a full-length making of K S Ravikumar’s Kochadiyaan starring Rajinikanth. That was a 3D motion capture where the performance was fed over animated characters.
Dolby Atmos – Sivaji 3D (2012)
This is the state-of-the-art sound technology available till date (except for 2.0’s SRL). Through this, a complete atmosphere of sound would be recreated inside a cinema hall. Especially when it rains in a movie or a chopper is flying above in an action sequence, those things will be completely reprised by this tech inside the theatres."
Rajini’s ‘2.0’: Theatres keen to opt for 3D technology,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/11/16/rajinis-2-0-theatres-keen-to-opt-for-3d-technology/,"November 16, 2018",M BHARAT KUMAR,Technology,"Chennai: Director Shankar’s mega venture 2.0, starring Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar, is all set for release 29 November.
A sci-fi thriller being made on a budget of Rs 600 crore, the film was shot in 3D format. And with the release date nearing, there is frantic enquiries among theatre owners to instal 3D screens.
Speaking to News Today, a theatre-owner in Alandur, said, “We will give it a shot. We consider a Rajini-starrer in 3D format a safe bet. We are in talks with producers in this regard.”
Remember, Shankar had appealed to exhibitors a few days ago to upgrade their existing infrastructure to screen the 3D version?
Sources say the producers (Lyca International) have connected theatre-owners with those who are supplying the equipment for converting screens to 3D directly. Some of the theatres had required 2K projectors and the ‘silver screen’, but they didn’t have the equipment to convert it into 3D. In such cases, Lyca helped the theatre-owners to be in touch with suppliers.
Sources in the trade say that the silver screen costs Rs 3-4 lakh. With 3D films being touted as the future, there is a feeling that many theatres will opt for it. Also plans are being made to help theatres hire 3D technology for the film.
When Rajini’s Kochadaiyaan was out in 3D format (shot in motion capture technology) similar arrangements were made. As of now, 2.0 will be out in 3D format in over 450 screens while in the rest it will be in 2D format, say sources close to Lyca.
The movie, a sequel to Enthiran, has been in the making for over three years. Cleared with a U/A certificate, 2.0 has been in the news for a long time due to various reasons, one being its visual effects, involving the work of 3,000 technicians around the world
Amy Jackson, Adil Hussain and Sudhanshu Pandey are also in the cast.
The film, which will release in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi, will mark the Tamil debut of Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar.
The cinematography department is handled by Nirav Shah, while music is scored by A R Rahman. About the movie, Shankar, said, “Audiences will see Rajini as scientist Vaseegaran, robot Chitti and 2.0 version of Chitti. There will also be a giant version of Chitti in the climax. We also have another version but we’d like to keep that as a surprise.”"
TN has been early adopter of new technology: Samsung Dy GM,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/10/26/tn-has-been-early-adopter-of-new-technology-samsung-dy-gm/,"October 26, 2018",Praveen Kumar S,Technology,"Chennai: Consumer electronics giant, Samsung India, announced the launch of its new top-load washing machine of the digital inverter range here. With the launch of the new range, Samsung aims to increase its market share and further strengthen its game.
The range starts at Rs Rs 24,990 and comes with what Samsung calls “Make for India” ActivWash+ concept. The washing machine is powered by a digital inverter motor which the firm claims consumes 40 per cent less energy while producing minimal noise and vibration.
The inverter series also comes with Stainless Steel Pulsator, which offers complete hygiene and is corrosion resistant, says Seoul headquartered electronics giant.
At the launch, News Today caught up with Maneesh Sharma, who is at present the deputy general manager of the Consumer Electronics Business at Samsung India.
He said, “In today’s fast paced modern lifestyle, consumers want washing solutions that are quick, fuss-free, all-in-one and convenient. The new top load washing machine provides this and much more.”
According to Maneesh, Samsung’s ‘Make for India’ ActivWash+ concept has been receiving overwhelming response from consumers, which is why, the firm brings in new innovations around the solution every year.
“We introduced the magic dispenser in 2016, stainless steel pulsator last year and the new digital inverter direct drive motor this year,” he added.
Asked about the Chennai and Tamilnadu markets, the deputy GM said Samsung is at the top in both the State and the State capital.
Speaking about the contribution of Tamilnadu to Samsung’s market share, Maneesh said, “In the fully automatic space, Tamilnadu contributes around 15-16 per cent in the top-load and front-load segment. In the semi-automatic segment, we have around four to five per cent (market share). So, predominantly if you ask me, Tamilnadu is a top and front-load market.”
When asked if he could specify the southern State as one that buys more fully automatic machines, he replied affirmatively, saying, ‘It has been that case. Early adoption of technology has been prevalent and that’s the reason why front-loads have been popular in Tamilnadu. Even the top-load segment does exceedingly well. Semi-automatic has always been the third segment here.’
Maneesh added that the focus is shifting towards automatics in the State and stated that Samsung has developed the new technology in-house using the R&D team’s expertise.
Speaking about financing, which is turning out to be a big industry in itself, due to factors like cost and increasing reach in rural areas, Maneesh said, “What we focus at Samsung is the affordability and the value proposition to the consumer. Because, if there is a cost of a product, and if the consumer sees value out of it, then they will make a purchase. We have strong affordability programmes. What we have got right now are the best in the industry. There is a 15 per cent cashback as well. Other brands giving to the max 10 per cent. Thus we have potent ways to increase affordability.”
About washing machines contributing to the whole Samsung consumer electronics enterprise, he said, “We are doing pretty well. We have good growth rate in the washing machine. This has been a good year for us.” He also mentioned that the 12-year warranty pack is testimony to their product quality.
Innovation and IoT
Maneesh was asked if Samsung will focus more on interconnecting their machines. He replied, “We have an IoT enabled machine in our portfolio that is at the top-end of the front load. It is an IoT enabled washing machine. The affordable range currently does not have the feature. If the consumer asks for such a product, we do have one. (In future) If the case is strong and if the price dynamics allow, we will definitely do it.”
  The stats
At the moment, Samsung owns 31 per cent market share in the TV series and ini the fridge segment, the number is better at 41 per cent. The top-load segment in washing machines sees Samsung hold 35 per cent marketshare and the firm aims to increase it by a further five per cent by year end.
The total washing machine market size is 65 lakh units, equating to around Rs 11,000 crore. By the end of the festive season, Samsung plans to increase share by 2.5 per cent and out do the industry growth.

EVM technology is foolproof: CEC Rawat,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/08/evm-technology-is-foolproof-cec-rawat/,"August 8, 2018",PTI,Technology,"Nagpur: Chief Election Commissioner O P Rawat today said the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a foolproof technology and has not witnessed any malfunctioning in the past several years.
“The maximum failure rate of EVM is 0.5 per cent,” Rawat said, delivering a lecture organised by the Dainik Bhaskar group here.
Even this failure rate was because of initial glitches experienced in Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail machines which were introduced in 2017, he said. However, experts from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, have examined the cause of these glitches and the VVPAT machines functioned smoothly in the recent by-elections in the country, he said.
Talking about the demand of reintroduction of ballot paper by some political parties who are sceptical about EVMs, Rawat said, “The Election Commission will be speaking with the political parties concerned which have sought time to discuss the issue, and clearing their doubts.”
In the past, lakhs of votes would be declared invalid during ballot paper voting for reasons such as wrong stamping, he pointed out. To stress that the polling process has improved, he cited “Electoral integrity perception index”, a project of Harvard and Sydney Universities. India got a score of 59 out of 100 as per this index for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, while the score improved to 69 out of 100 one year later, after the 2015 Bihar elections, he said.
“The Election Commission is continuously taking steps, be it in use of technology or in addressing the concerns of any voter, party or candidate….We are committed to address the concerns and clear the doubts all stake-holders,” Rawat said.
He also touched on the role played by “big data firms” such as Cambridge Analytica.
“Money is being pumped into these firms to carry out a very detailed and minute research on the prospective voter to get accurate guidance on how to influence them. This kind of influencing is slowly taking place in our country, however, it has already influenced elections in many developed countries,” he said. “
“It is a matter of grave concern and danger as physical movement of money can be curbed but misuse of money in elections is taking place in other form as these,” said Rawat."

Sydney: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison lost control of his account on the Chinese-owned social media platform WeChat and a lawmaker on Monday accused China’s leaders of political interference.
Morrison’s 76,000 WeChat followers were notified his page had been renamed Australian Chinese new life earlier this month and his photograph had been removed, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported. The changes were made without the government’s knowledge, the report said. Morrison’s office declined to comment on the report.
The owner of the Chinese social media platform WeChat insists there is no evidence of any hacking or third-party intrusion of Scott Morrison’s account.
Coalition members have vowed to boycott WeChat in retaliation for the prime minister’s account being taken over and rebranded as Australian Chinese new life” earlier this month.
But WeChat’s owner, Chinese tech giant Tencent, says an ownership dispute is behind the rebranding of Morrison’s account and there is no evidence of any hacking or third-party intrusion.
Based on our information, this appears to be a dispute over account ownership, Tencent said in a statement on Monday.
The account in question was originally registered by a PRC individual and was subsequently transferred to its current operator, a technology services company – and it will be handled in accordance with our platform rules.

India’s economy has dark stains: Raghuram Rajan,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/24/indias-economy-has-dark-stains-raghuram-rajan/,"January 24, 2022",NT Bureau,Technology,"Raghuram Rajan
Mumbai: The Indian economy has ‘some bright spots and a number of very dark stains’ and the government should target its spending ‘carefully’ so that there are no huge deficits, noted economist and former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Sunday.
Known for his frank views, Rajan also said the government needs to do more to prevent a K-shaped recovery of the economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Generally, a K-shaped recovery will reflect a situation where technology and large capital firms recover at a far faster rate than small businesses and industries that have been significantly impacted by the pandemic.
‘My greater worry about the economy is the scarring to the middle class, the small and medium sector, and our children’s minds, all of which will come into play after an initial rebound due to pent up demand. One symptom of all this is weak consumption growth, especially for mass consumption goods,’Rajan told PTI in an e-mail interview.
Rajan, currently a Professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, noted that as always, the economy has some bright spots and a number of very dark stains. ”The bright spots are the health of large firms, the roaring business the IT and IT-enabled sectors are doing, including the emergence of unicorns in a number of areas, and the strength of some parts of the financial sector,” he said.
On the other hand, ‘dark stains’ are the extent of unemployment and low buying power, especially amongst the lower middle-class, the financial stress small and medium-sized firms are experiencing, ‘including the very tepid credit growth, and the tragic state of our schooling’.
Rajan opined that Omicron is a setback, both medically and in terms of economic activity but cautioned the government on the possibility of a K-shaped economic recovery.
‘We need to do more to prevent a K shaped recovery, as well as a possible lowering of our medium term growth potential,’ he said.
The country’s GDP is expected to grow over 9 per cent in the current financial year that ends on March 31. The economy, which was significantly hit by the pandemic, had contracted 7.3 per cent in the last fiscal. Ahead of the Union Budget, Rajan said that budgets are supposed to be documents containing a vision and he would love to see a five- or ten-year vision for India as well as a plan for the kinds of institutions and frameworks the government intends to set up.

Geneva: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday called for dialogue and negotiation between the United States and China over trade and technology to avoid the polarization of the world market and economy.
Asked to comment on Washington’s years-old technology dispute with China, Guterres said he has always advocated for the need for a unified global market and a unified global economy, Xinhua reported.
I’ve been, many times, saying that we need to avoid at all costs the division of the world into two, each with its own economic system and set of rules, each with its own dominant currency, each with its own internet, and each with its own technological strategy and artificial intelligence and in other aspects, he told at a press briefing.
Guterres called on the world’s two largest economies to find common ground over trade and technology through dialogue and negotiation to avoid such a scenario, as per Xinhua. Now, it is clear that, at the present moment, there are a number of differences, he said, adding I’ve been advocating, both with US and with China, on the importance of a serious dialogue and a serious negotiation.

Vikram Sahay, Joint Secretary (P&A), Ministry of Information and Broadcasting informed, ‘The common factor amongst all these accounts have been that they operate from Pakistan and spread fake anti-India news and other content.’
Information and Broadcasting Secretary Apurva Chandra said the order was issued on Thursday using emergency powers under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. He said the intermediaries, including YouTube, were in the process of blocking the channels, something which takes around 24 hours.
Terming it a ‘war of misinformation against the country’, Chandra said the latest channels to be blocked were the second set, after 20 were blocked in December 2021. He said the content was against the sovereignty of the country.
‘The blocked accounts have contents on Indian Armed Forces, Kashmir, India’s foreign relation with other countries and the death of former CDS Bipin Rawat,’ said the Information and Broadcasting Ministry.

New AI-based test uses X-rays to detect Covid in few minutes,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/21/new-ai-based-test-uses-x-rays-to-detect-covid-in-few-minutes/,"January 21, 2022",Agency,Technology,"Birmingham: Scientists in Scotland have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) based test that uses X-rays to accurately diagnose Covid-19 in just a few minutes.
The testing platform developed by researchers at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) is able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus far more quickly than a PCR test which typically takes around two hours.
The technology can eventually be used to help relieve strain on hard-pressed hospitals, particularly in countries where PCR tests are not readily available, they said.
The technique utilises X-ray technology, comparing scans to a database of around 3000 images belonging to patients with Covid-19, healthy individuals and people with viral pneumonia.
It then uses an AI process known as deep convolutional neural network, an algorithm typically used to analyse visual imagery, to make a diagnosis.
According to the research published in the journal Sensors, the technique proved to be more than 98 per cent accurate during an extensive testing phase.
There has long been a need for a quick and reliable tool that can detect Covid-19, and this has become even more true with the upswing of the Omicron variant, said Professor Naeem Ramzan from UWS, who led the research.
Several countries are unable to carry out large numbers of Covid tests because of limited diagnosis tools, but this technique utilises easily accessible technology to quickly detect the virus, Ramzan said.
The researchers noted that Covid-19 symptoms are not visible in X-rays during the early stages of infection, so the technology cannot fully replace PCR tests.
However, it can still play an important role in curtailing the viruses spread especially when PCR tests are not readily available, they said.
It could prove to be crucial, and potentially life-saving, when diagnosing severe cases of the virus, helping determine what treatment may be required, Ramzan said.
The team now plans to expand the study, incorporating a greater database of X-ray images acquired by different models of X-ray machines, to evaluate the suitability of the approach in a clinical setting.

"S Korea, S Arabia to jointly develop hydrogen economy",https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/19/s-korea-s-arabia-to-jointly-develop-hydrogen-economy/,"January 19, 2022",Agency,Technology,"Riyadh: South Korean President Moon Jae-in held talks with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday and agreed to work together in areas related to the hydrogen economy.
After holding the talks at the Al-Yamamah palace in Riyadh, the two nations signed preliminary deals to jointly develop green hydrogen, which is produced from renewable energy sources, especially solar and wind, and jointly build a hydrogen ecosystem, Yonhap news agency reported, citing a statement by Moon’s office.
Under the deals, South Korea can secure a supply of carbon-neutral hydrogen and ammonia from Saudi Arabia. In return, Seoul can help Riyadh operate hydrogen-powered cars and hydrogen fueling stations, according to the statement.
During the talks, Moon took note of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 policy of reducing the Arab nation’s dependence on oil and developing its public service sector.
Moon also affirmed that the two nations have expanded cooperation beyond construction, infrastructure and energy into fields such as hydrogen, defense, intellectual property and medicine.
Saudi Arabia is South Korea’s largest trading partner in the Middle East. The kingdom is also the biggest supplier of crude oil to South Korea.
Prince Mohammed bin Salman voiced support for Moon’s efforts to bring peace on the Korean Peninsula, according to the statement.
Moon was in Dubai on Monday, when an attack claimed by Houthi rebels triggered a blast at a construction site in Abu Dhabi that killed three people. Yemen’s Houthi rebels also recently seized a UAE-flagged vessel in the Red Sea.
During the talks, Moon said that he “strongly condemns” the seizure and any activity that “threatens peace and stability in the Middle East,” according to Moon’s spokesperson Park Kyung-mee.
Moon told the crown prince that he hopes the ship and her crew will be freed and return home safely.
Moon and the crown prince also discussed potential deals on defense and weapons systems as well as Korea’s nuclear fusion reactors, Park said.
South Korea has been in negotiations with Saudi Arabia to sell advanced weapons to Riyadh. Moon told the crown prince that he expects positive results from the negotiations, Park told reporters.
Moon also expressed his confidence that South Korea will become an “optimal partner” for Saudi Arabia’s plans to build nuclear power plants, Park said.
After the talks, Moon delivered a keynote speech at a business forum.  “Saudi Arabia, which has the potential to produce clean hydrogen such as green and blue hydrogen, and South Korea, which has strengths in hydrogen utilization based on hydrogen-powered cars and fuel cell technology, must closely cooperate to lead the global hydrogen economy,” Moon told the forum.
Moon urged Saudi Arabian business leaders to expand business cooperation with South Korea into sectors related to public health and digital technology as a way to cope with a post-pandemic era.
Moon also met with Yasir al-Rumayyan, chairman of Aramco, the kingdom’s state oil giant. The Aramco chairman also heads Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund.
Moon told the Aramco chairman that cooperating with South Korea’s hydrogen-related companies would present investment opportunities for Saudi Arabia.
The trip to Saudi Arabia followed a four-day visit to Dubai that included the signing of a preliminary deal with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to sell midrange surface-to-air missiles in the latest sign of deepening defense cooperation between the two nations.

"FADA seeks GST cut on two-wheeler, used car segments",https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/18/fada-seeks-gst-cut-on-two-wheeler-used-car-segments/,"January 18, 2022",NT Bureau,Technology,"Mumbai: The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) has urged the Centre to reduce GST on two-wheelers to boost sales volume.
According to FADA, reduction in GST rate will somewhat counter the continuous price hike in the two-wheeler segment and create fresh demand.
For the used car segment, the federation urged the Centre to reduce GST rate to flat 5 per cent from the present 12 per cent and 18 per cent for two different categories of vehicles.
“Reduction in GST will help the industry shift from unorganised segment to organised segment, thus bringing in more business under the ambit of GST helping in putting brake on tax leakages,” it added. Besides, it seeks reduction in corporate tax to 25 pc for ‘LLP’, proprietary and partnership firms in line with private limited companies.
Meanwhile, as per PwC Annual Global CEO Survey released on Monday, as many as 99% of top CEOs in India believe India’s economic growth will improve over the next 12 months. When it comes to the revenue prospects of their own companies, 98% of CEOs are confident about growth in the same time period.
As many as 94% Indian CEOs are optimistic about global economic growth improving over the next 12 months, as against 77% of global CEOs. The survey carried out between October-November, 2021 covered 4,446 CEOs in 89 countries and territories. The India highlights include insights from 77 CEOs from India.
While for the most part, CEOs globally are at least as optimistic as they were last year about the prospects for economic growth in 2022, the optimism of India CEOs up from 88% last year stands out at 94%, noted the PwC survey.
While there is optimism, concerns about some clear threats for India’s CEOs continue to remain. They listed out cyber risks, health risks and rising geopolitical conflict among key challenges going forward.
After a challenging year, business leaders are under pressure to deliver top-line results. It will require them to take proactive steps to mitigate current and future risks be they around technology, cyber security, talent or health, said Sanjeev Krishan, Chairman, PwC India.
Despite rising interest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG), long-term strategy for most companies is still primarily driven by business metrics, both globally and in India. Most CEOs have goals related to non financial outcomes, the survey highlighted.

And presiding over the function will be Janaganandhini’s late father’s avatar.
‘I feel so proud and blessed that I have seen and taken advantage of many great opportunities in this world before millions of people have seen them, Beginning of something big! India’s first #metaverse marriage in Polygon blockchain collaborated with TardiVerse Metaverse startup,’ Dinesh said in a tweet.
Dinesh has even shared a small video giving a sneak peek into what the function could potentially look like.
A project associate at IIT Madras, Dinesh explained, ‘My fiancé’s father passed away last April. We created a realistic 3d virtual avatar in metaverse (for him) to attend our marriage function. It would be a new way of the afterlife in the metaverse, and I hope it would be a great event in the metaverse for first timers in India.’
Janaganandhini said, ‘It’s apt in a way as we met on Instagram and will be having our wedding reception on Meta’.
Metaverse is a virtual reality world where users can ‘live’ and interact with others through digital avatars. It combines multiple elements of technology like augmented reality, blockchain and virtual reality.

India’s rich ancient heritage continues to remain ‘young’ in the lives of Indians and reflects in our day-to-day live, he said.
‘When India searched for faith, glorious sons like Guru Govind Sigh stood up; when India searched for freedom, sons like Bhagat Singh, Chendrashekar Azad stood up. When India needed spiritual inclination, we found Shri Aurobindo and Subramania Bharati. When India needed to find self-respect, a son like Swami Vivekananda came along,’ he said.
He said The National Youth Festival aims to shape the minds of India’s youth and transform them into a united force for nation-building and bring diverse cultures of India and integrate them into a united thread of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’.

ISRO gearing up for series of missions this year: Sivan,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/05/isro-gearing-up-for-series-of-missions-this-year-sivan/,"January 5, 2022",NT Bureau,Technology,"K Sivan
Chennai: After a subdued 2021 hit by Covid pandemic, the Indian Space Agency is gearing up for the New Year with a series of missions for 2022.
In his New Year message, to ISRO scientists, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman Dr K Sivan said, ‘last year, we had two missions in which one was a dedicated commercial mission by NSIL. The GSLV-F10/EOS-03 mission failed due to cryogenic stage anomaly.’
A national level failure analysis committee was constituted for the same and the committee has identified the root cause and given its recommendations. Necessary design changes are being incorporated to improve the robustness of concerned systems, Dr Sivan said.
The GSLV-F10, carrying the Earth Observation Satellite, EOS-03, took off from the SHAR Range, Sriharikota on 12 August, 2021 at 5.43 am as scheduled. The performance of first and second stages was normal. However, the Cryogenic Upper Stage ignition did not happen due to technical anomaly and the mission could not be accomplished as intended.
Announcing the plans for 2022, Dr Sivan said, ‘if you look, at the immediate task at hand this year, we have many missions to execute, including the first unmanned Gaganyaan mission.’
He said some of launch missions were EOS-4 and EOS-6 on board PSLV. Launch of EOS-02 on board maiden flight of the Small Sattelite Launch Vehicle (SSLV).
Many test flights for Crew Escape System of Gaganyaan and launch of the first unmanned mission of Gaganyaan would also take place this year.
‘In addition, we also have Chandrayaan-03 mission, Aditya Ll, XpoSat, IRNSS and technology demonstration missions with advanced indigenously developed technologies on-board’, Dr Sivan said.
Dr Sivan said ISRO has three new space science missions in the pipeline. They included DISHA, a twin aeronomy satellite mission, Venus mission and ISROCNES joint science mission TRISHNA.
TRISHNA mission is meant for accurate mapping of land surface temperatures. This mission will be the benchmark for providing temperature data at best resolution and repeatability even globally, Dr Sivan, who is also the Chairman of the Space Commission and Secretary, Department of Space, said.
India’s flagship GAGANYAAN project has completed the design phase and has entered into the testing phase, he said.
‘Tests are in progress for human rated Ll 10 Vikas engine, Cryogenic stage, Crew escape system motors and service module propulsion system. S200 motor has been realised for ground test too. Main parachute drop test has also commenced’, he said, adding, the Astronauts have completed the generic spaceflight training abroad.
The Indian leg of mission specific training has also commenced. A comprehensive training plan has been worked out and state-of-the art accommodation-cum-training facility has been established for the same, Dr Sivan said.
He said ISRO has formulated a decadal plan for the Indian Space Programme as the space industry was changing very rapidly and service demands ballooning.
‘Today, when we look forward, we not only look forward to the next year, but to the next decade. Sound planning is essential for the next decade given that the space industry is changing very rapidly and service demands from space industry is ballooning’, Dr Sivan said.
‘We have formulated the decadal plan for the Indian Space Programme for the country as a whole. The decadal plan is formulated by keeping the ethos of space sector reforms to enable the national space sector which includes ISRO, academia and private sector. This is to foster all-round growth in operational missions, launch services, science missions, technology demonstration missions and new technology development initiatives’, he said.
Efforts have also been made to map the future space sector activities with growth drivers and disruptive technologies. Emphasis has been paid to identify and develop the technologies of the future especially the disruptive technologies which may make the existing space systems obsolete, he said.

Chennai: Youtuber and Naam Tamizhar functionary ‘Saattai’ Duraimurugan, who came out on bail in a defamation case recently, has been arrested again, this time for spreading rumours on protest by Foxconn women staff.
Sources said he was arrested in Tiruchi by a team of police after a fresh case was filed.
Thousands of women employees of Foxconn Technology firm, which assembles and manufactures smart phone components, staged a marathon road roko agiation on the busy Chennai-Bengaluru National highway after reports of two of their staffs had died due to food poisoning went viral in the social media.
As the reports went viral, women employees, who were staying in various dormitories in and around Sriperumbudur where the facility of the Taiwan-based firm was located, resorted to a flash protest at Sunguvarchathiram last night, affecting traffic on the highway, resulting in pile up vehicles to a distance of about five to six kms.
As they continued with their protests despite the Collector promising action against the cook for not providing quality food, Rural Industries Minister T M Anbarasan and Labour Minister C V Ganesan held marathon talks following which they called off their nearly 13-hour long agitation.

What led to Omicron outbreak,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/20/what-led-to-omicron-outbreak/,"December 20, 2021",NT Bureau,Technology,"Chennai: Canada’s Covid-19 vaccination rate is 76 per cent 10 times higher than it is across the continent of Africa. While people in the wealthy West have had preferred access to multiple rounds of vaccines, vast numbers of people, especially in Africa and on the Indian subcontinent, haven’t received a single dose.
This has permitted the virus to thrive and accelerated the process of mutation, adding months and perhaps years to the pandemic, according to Dawn ME Bowdish, Canada Research Chair in Aging & Immunity, McMaster University and Chandrima Chakraborty, Professor, English and Cultural Studies; Director, Centre for Peace Studies, McMaster University.
In a The Converstation article, they said Wherever Covid-19 has the chance to linger, variants develop and travel. This entirely predictable pattern is destined to repeat itself unless countries with resources share vaccines with others that cannot afford them.
‘Wealthy countries have yet to meet their pledges to provide equitable global access to vaccines via COVAX (an international collaboration to procure and distribute Covid-19 vaccines) and other initiatives. The resulting lack of broad global vaccine coverage made the rise of another variant like Omicron inevitable. For Canada, it is more critical than ever to carefully balance the supply of vaccines available for domestic use while prioritising international sharing and encouraging regional manufacturing.’
When the Covid-19 crisis started, major manufacturers pre-sold their vaccines to governments as they were being developed but before they were tested, as a way of funding their work, including clinical trials. Canada and other developed countries ordered millions of doses, enough to cover their populations many times over, with promises to share their excess vaccines with other countries. That has not happened quickly enough. While logistical, legal and other barriers did impede the wider distribution of vaccines, there appears to be a lack of will to overcome them. The momentum gained by accelerating the development of vaccinations has now been lost, they said.
‘Hundreds of vials with red lids on a conveyor belt Vials waiting to be filled with Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine at a production plant in France. Third doses and booster shots will be important to controlling both the ongoing threat of Delta and the spread of Omicron. Canadians should certainly heed public health guidance and get their shots when they are recommended. Once vaccine doses are in Canadian freezers and fridges they aren’t going anywhere, and declining a dose won’t mean that it is redistributed to other parts of the world that need them. On a federal level, Canada should only buy what is needed domestically and commit to accelerating the distribution of vaccines elsewhere. The same is true for all wealthy countries.’
According to the authors, watching the rise of Omicron is particularly frustrating. It has been apparent since the outset that the spread of Covid-19 needed to be slowed globally, precisely to prevent variants from emerging.
That message should have been clearer after the spread of the agile Alpha variant. It should have been clearer still from the swift attack of the Delta variant.
Variants like Delta and Omicron will arise when the burden of infection is high and vaccination rates are low, as is the case with many countries in the Global South. Identifying variants by their country of origin perpetuates a long legacy of representing racialized people as originators or carriers of disease.
In fact, the world has been served well by South Africa’s admirable investments in disease surveillance that turned up the newest Covid-19 threat.
There is no way to know where in the world the Omicron variant actually emerged, even though it was first detected in South Africa. South Africa has been down this road before with HIV, and had a well-developed pandemic surveillance system that allowed it to detect this variant, they added.
Sharing knowledge and technology that can help countries in the Global South develop vaccines and vaccinate their own populations will have a greater long-term benefit for the world than trying to stop variants by closing borders.

YouTuber Maridhas arrested again,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/17/youtuber-maridhas-arrested-again/,"December 17, 2021",NT Bureau,Technology,"M Maridhas
Tirunelveli: The Tirunelveli police have arrested YouTuber M.Maridhas in connection with the First Information Report (FIR) registered against him in 2020 for a video post insinuating ‘Tablighi Jamaat’ in the spread of Coronavirus and stoking communal sentiments.
Maridhas was arrested for the third time in a span of one week. He was already arrested in two cases of which the Madras High Court has quashed the FIR in respect of one case.
Sources said Maridhas posted the video in his YouTube channel, titled ‘Terrorism + Corona = India’s new problem Tablighi Jamaat’ on 2 April, 2020 in which he stated that the Tablighi Jamaat event at Nizamuddin in New Delhi during March, 2020 was responsible for great number of people being infected with the virus.
He said Covid is being deliberately spread by (Muslim) terrorists to murder innocents across the World. The supporters of this terrorism protect themselves with their Muslim identity and then allege discrimination in order to protect themselves, he alleged.
On a complaint from Tamilnadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam functionary Mohamed Kadar Meeran on 4 April, 2020 the Melapalayam police in Tirunelveli registered a case against Maridhas under sections 292A (printing, etc., of grossly indecent or scurrilous matter or matter intended for black mail), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 505(2) (statements conducing to public mischief with intent to cause fear) and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act.
Maridhas, who has been lodged in Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai, was brought to Tirunelveli amid tight security this afternoon and was produced before the Judicial Magistrate court, which remanded him to custody till 30 December. He was later lodged in Theni prison.
Earlier, Maridhas was arrested by the Madurai city police on 9 December for posting a controversial tweet that questioned whether Tamilnadu was turning into another Kashmir under the DMK rule, after the recent IAF chopper crash in which CDS General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 others died in Nilgiris district.
He said many DK and DMK supporters can be seen posting ‘emojis’ mocking the death of the army commander. They do this every time. It is an undeniable fact that the DMK has been the best choice for separatist forces.
He alleged that the State gives freedom to create a group that can do any level of treason against the country, there is a possibility for any kind of conspiracy to be hatched here.
But, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court had on 14 December quashed the FIR on the grounds that none of the offences mentioned in the FIR are made out in this case.
In a second case, the Central Crime Branch of Chennai police recorded Maridhas’s arrest on 11 December in connection with a case registered against him last year pertaining to a complaint filed by News 18 Tamil
Channel for forging an e-mail purported to be that of an associate executive editor of the News 18 media group.

However, the BJP sympathiser is unlikely to come out of jail anytime soon, since he was arrested in another case. The Egmore Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Court on Monday remanded Maridhas, arrested on a complaint by News18 Media Group, in judicial custody till 27 December.
Maridhas, who was already arrested by the Madurai City Police in connection with another case pertaining to his critical comments against the ruling DMK and lodged in Theni Prison, was formally arrested in Nes18 Media Group case by the Cyber Crime Wing of the Tamilnadu police on Saturday.
He was brought from Theni and produced before CMM N Kothandaraj who remanded him in judicial custody. The Cyber Crime police registered on a complaint for allegedly forging an e-mail purported to be that of an associate executive editor of the News18 media group.

The media group also said that about 2,500 people emailed the company /channel at the instigation of Maridhas, making similar false and baseless allegations which were received at its Chennai office.
In another YouTube video, Maridhas displayed an e-mail which was allegedly sent to him by Sarawagi, showing that the latter on behalf of the channel management accepted the allegations leveled against him in Maridhas’s earlier YouTube video.
Sarwagi said that the e-mail was not sent by him and that it was forged with the intention to spread fake news and cause damage and harm the reputation of the channel.
Acting on the complaint, Maridhas was formally arrested in this case and remanded in custody.

Health Minister M Subramanian said the Director of technical education and the Director of collegiate education will write to colleges asking them to ensure only vaccinated students are permitted.
Over the past few weeks, the public health department and the Greater Chennai Corporation have found that in most educational institutions the risk of spread of infection is high in the canteens and dining area. New regulations will make it mandatory for colleges to ensure that students are served food in disposable containers. ‘To avoid overcrowding, colleges must send them to canteens in batches,’ Subramanian said.
The Minister also said that student get-togethers and functions must not be held without prior permission from the Health Department. He also said that students must bring in food in disposable containers and be sent to canteens in batches.
An alert was sounded to higher education institutions in Tamilnadu to follow Covid-19 safety norms after ten students of an Anna University college in Chennai have tested positive for Covid-19.

He said the samples from the cluster would be sent for genome sequencing to check the virus variant.
He also expressed concern over educational institutes emerging as Covid clusters. Students don’t wear masks in the canteen, and sit close to each other, causing the virus to spread fast, the minister said.

Trump social media venture under scrutiny by regulators,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/07/trump-social-media-venture-under-scrutiny-by-regulators/,"December 7, 2021",Agency,Technology,"Washington: Regulators are asking questions about the deal to bring Donald Trump’s new social media company to the stock market, one that has attracted both legions of fans of the former president and people looking to make a quick profit.
The company partnering with Trump Media & Technology Group acknowledged the inquiries in a filing it made with regulators on Monday. It also gave some financial forecasts for the company, which is hoping to rival Twitter and other platforms that banned Trump, along with Netflix and other streaming video services.
Digital World Acquisition, which is often referred to by its trading symbol of “DWAC,” said it is cooperating with ”the preliminary, fact-finding inquiries” by the Financial Industry Regulation Authority and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Financial Industry Regulation Authority, or FINRA, asked in late October and early November for a review of trading in DWAC’s stock before the Oct. 20 merger deal was announced. That announcement sent the stock surging from USD 9.96 to USD 94.20 in just two days as Trump supporters and investors looking to make a fast buck piled in. The shares have since pulled back to roughly USD 43.
The Securities and Exchange Commission made a request in early November for documents related to meetings of DWAC’s board, trading policies and other things. According to DWAC, the SEC’s request said the commission’s “investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of DWAC or any person, event, or security.” DWAC said over the weekend that it has lined up USD 1 billion in promised investments for the former president’s new venture from a group of unnamed institutional investors, and it filed a copy of the presentation used to pitch investors and analysts.
The presentation included forecasts that the company’s Truth Social service may have 81 million users by 2026, or nearly 7 million more people than voted for Trump in the last U.S. presidential election.
In five years, Trump Media is forecast to generate nearly USD 3.7 billion in revenue, according to the filing. That is more than the annual revenue of retailer Restoration Hardware, RV maker Winnebago Industries and entertainment giant iHeart Media, which owns more than 800 radio stations.
DWAC was shaky in Monday morning trading following the filing. It opened with a slight gain before falling to a 2.2 per cent loss.

This will be the first in-person meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Putin after their meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brasilia in November 2019.
In his second overseas trip since the pandemic, Putin seeks to bolster military and energy ties with a traditional ally being courted by Washington.
Several agreements to deepen cooperation in defence, trade, space, technology, energy and culture are expected to be inked during the summit.
The Russian President is scheduled to hand over the model of an S-400 air defence system to Modi.
For the Modi government, Putin’s visit means more than just bolstering ties. Reportedly, India also needs Russia to keep up weapons supplies as it remains locked in its worst border standoff with China and New Delhi also wants more of a role in Afghanistan where Russia along with China and Pakistan remain key players following the Taliban’s takeover.
‘The friendship between India and Russia has stood the test of time,’ PM Modi told Putin at a virtual summit in September. ‘You have always been a great friend of India.’
It is only the Russian leader’s second trip abroad since the coronavirus pandemic began — he skipped both the G20 and COP26 summits this year — after a June summit with US President Joe Biden in Geneva.
Before the summit, there will be an inaugural session of the India-Russia 2+2 dialogue, where Russia’s Defence and Foreign Ministers will hold talks with their Indian counterparts. This highlights the increasing mutuality of strategic interests between the two close partners. Reportedly, the dialogue is expected to focus on ‘political and defence issues of mutual interest’."

IIT-Madras studies impact of disabilities on hiring decisions,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/30/iit-madras-studies-impact-of-disabilities-on-hiring-decisions/,"November 30, 2021",NT Bureau,Technology,"Chennai: Indian Institute of Technology-Madras researchers conducted a study based on the differences in employment rates among persons with disabilities, arising from diverse nature of their disabilities.
While the disparity in employment rates between persons with disabilities and the rest of the workforce has been highlighted as a cause for concern in several studies, factors contributing to the differences in employment rates within the heterogenous group of people with disabilities has received lesser attention.
Uneven representation of persons with varied types of disabilities in the workforce underscores the need for organizations to seek talent beyond familiar types of disabilities. As employers play a critical role in promoting employment of persons with disabilities, this study explored leaders’ perspectives on key factors that direct their decisions regarding targeted recruitment of persons with various types of disabilities.
The research was undertaken by Dr. Lata Dyaram, Associate Professor, Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras, and her Doctoral Student, Ms. Vasanthi Suresh.
Highlighting the key findings of this study, Lata Dyaram said, ‘based on interviews with leaders of 17 Public and Private Sector Organisations, the study reiterates the uneven representation of persons with various types of disabilities in organizations and identified some organization specific determinants (such as knowledge about type of disability, work characteristics, accommodations, accessibility and external pressures) that shape employer decisions.’

When the petition came up for hearing, Justice K Murali Shankar granted bail on the condition that the YouTuber should deposit Rs 50,000 to the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund.
The Judge also directed him not to make any further derogatory remarks through any medium.
Duraimurugan, who was running a YouTube channel ‘Saattai,’ was booked under IPC secs 143, 153, 153A, 504, 505 (1)(b), 505(2), 506 (i) and 269 read with Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases and Section 67 of Information Technology Act for his inflammatory speech during a protest on 10 November at Thuckalay in Kanyakumari district, in violation of the Covid-19 norms, besides making derogatory remarks against Stalin and Karunanidhi.
The YouTuber along with his bail petition had filed an undertaking that he would not make any derogatory remarks against any person in future.
The Judge observed that social networking had become the most ordinary tool for spreading hate speech, which has affected freedom of speech and expression widely in recent times and has given rise to social unrest and
public disturbances.
The Judge said Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution provides the right to freedom of speech and expression.
However, Article 19 (2) of the Constitution also provides for the reasonable restrictions against freedom of speech in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of the country, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence, he added.

First case of Omicron variant confirmed in Italy,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/29/first-case-of-omicron-variant-confirmed-in-italy/,"November 29, 2021",Agency,Technology,"Rome: The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been identified in a citizen from Italy’s Southern Campania region, who returned to Milan from Mozambique some days ago, Italian news agency ANSA reported Sunday.
The patient, an employee at an international company, had been vaccinated with two doses, ANSA reported.
On Sunday, the Campania region said in a statement that a citizen returning from southern Africa has tested positive, as did his family of five people. All his contacts have been immediately placed in isolation as a precautionary measure.
The genome was sequenced at Sacco Hospital in Milan from a positive sample taken from an individual coming from Mozambique. The patient and his family contacts are in good health, said the National Institute of Health on Saturday.
The World Health Organization declared on Friday the latest variant B.1.1.529 of SARS-CoV-2 to be of concern, its most serious level, and officially gave it the Greek name Omicron. The WHO has asked countries to enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts to fight the new variant. On Friday, Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza signed a travel ban on people who have visited South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini and Malawi in the past 14 days.
Dutch health authorities announced that the 13 cases of the variant were found among passengers who were on flights from South Africa that arrived in Amsterdam on Friday.
The discovery of Omicron, dubbed a “variant of concern” last week by the World Health Organization, has sparked worries around the world that it could resist vaccinations and prolong the nearly two-year COVID-19 pandemic.
First discovered in South Africa, the variant has since been detected in Britain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.
Health officials in Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, said two passengers who arrived in Sydney from southern Africa on Saturday evening had tested positive for the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
Both people were asymptomatic, fully vaccinated and in quarantine, NSW Health said. Another 12 passengers from southern Africa were also in 14 days of hotel quarantine, while around 260 other passengers and aircrew have been directed to isolate.
Austria was investigating a suspected case on Sunday and in France Health Minister Olivier Veran said the new variant was probably already circulating there.
Omicron is potentially more contagious than previous variants, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe COVID-19 compared to other strains.
Countries have imposed a wave of travel bans or curbs on southern Africa. Financial markets dived on Friday as investors worried that the variant could stall a global recovery. Oil prices tumbled by about $10 a barrel.
On Sunday, most Gulf stock markets fell sharply in early trade, with the Saudi index suffering its biggest single-day fall in nearly two years. read more
In the most far-reaching effort to keep the variant at bay, Israel announced late on Saturday it would ban the entry of all foreigners and reintroduce counter-terrorism phone-tracking technology to contain the spread of the variant.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the ban, pending government approval, would last 14 days. Officials hope that within that period there will be more information on how effective vaccines are against Omicron.
Many countries have imposed or are planning restrictions on travel from southern Africa. The South African government denounced this on Saturday as unfair and potentially harmful to its economy – saying it is being punished for its scientific ability to identify coronavirus variants early.
In Britain, where two linked cases of Omicron identified on Saturday were connected to travel to southern Africa, the government announced measures to try to contain the spread, including stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country and requiring mask wearing in some settings.
British health minister Sajid Javid said on Sunday he expected to receive advice imminently on whether the government can broaden a programme of providing booster shots to fully vaccinated people, to try to weaken the impact of the variant.

The UAE’s Ministry of Defense tweeted on Tuesday that it plans to acquire the missile, known as M-SAM. It did not elaborate further.
An official at South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) called the UAE’s announcement positive but noted negotiations have yet to be finalized, Yonhap news agency reported.
We still need to see how negotiations on the details will proceed, a DAPA official said on condition of anonymity.
The M-SAM system, called “Cheongung II,” is a core element of South Korea’s multi-layered anti-missile program. Cheongung, means heaven’s bow in Korean.
Employing the hit-to-kill technology, the missile is designed to intercept hostile missiles coming in at altitudes below 40 kilometers.
The state-run Agency for Defense Development launched the project to develop the M-SAM in 2012. The missile passed a suitability evaluation for field operations in 2017, and its mass-production began the following year.
A series of local defense firms, including LIG Nex1 and Hanwha Systems, have participated in the manufacturing of the missile.

Mahat Raghavendra plays the lead role in this movie that deals with the current pandemic crisis and the pharma corporate medical conspiracy.
Mouttou Sambandam says, ‘When I decided to embark on its journey into the world of movie productions, the earnest and inmost motif was to promote creative talents in the industry. Innovations and emotions coalesced together always win the hearts of all audiences. Precisely, we were in the pursuit of finding such scripts. Significantly, I felt this essence while flipping through director Andrew Pandian’s full-bound script of 2030. It holds a hard-hitting premise for the first of its kind Flash forward, a movie without involving the ‘Time Travel’ concept, which was exciting and challenging at the same time. More than all, the main plot revolves around the current pandemic crisis that prevails across nooks and corners of the world. The story mainly deals with the theme of common men and women suffering due to the Pharma Corporate Medical conspiracy and it does have a revenge element. The story travels from the year 2020  and ends in 2030.  Besides all these engrossing elements in the script, I found 2030 to be a unique one as it is the first-ever script I found moving forward rather than inclined to Flashbacks.
Mahat plays the male lead and we are sure that this film will mark his presence in the Tamil film industry much bigger from now on. The female lead is Swathi, a newcomer."

Editorial: US & China,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/17/editorial-us-china/,"November 17, 2021",NT Bureau,Technology,"No breakthroughs were delivered during talks between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, but the cordial tone of the virtual meeting is an indication that relations between the sides may be turning a corner — even if that means for now merely walking back from the heated exchanges of earlier this year.
Relations went into sharp decline after then-President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods in retaliation for what he said were Beijing’s unfair trading practices.
The US had for years been complaining of the theft or forced transfer of American technology and was campaigning to keep Chinese communications giants, most notably Huawei, out of the U.S. and other markets. The Trump administration also sharply criticized China on human rights issues.
Relations remained frosty after Biden took office. At a meeting in Alaska in March, senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi berated Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, accusing the US of failing to deal with its own human rights problems and taking issue with what he said was American hypocrisy.
A trip to China by America’s No. 2 diplomat Wendy Sherman in July was equally sour in tone, and a subsequent visit by US climate envoy John Kerry went little better. Relations appeared to bottom out when Sullivan and Yang met again in Switzerland last month, in a follow-up to a phone call between Xi and Biden. Sullivan made clear that the United States sought better engagement at a senior level ‘to ensure responsible competition,’ according to the White House.
The meeting laid the groundwork for the virtual meeting Tuesday between Xi and Biden, who have known each other since both were vice presidents. Xi referred to Biden as his ‘old friend’ and they lamented they were not meeting face-to-face before launching into 3 1/2 hours of discussions. The US described the talks as respectful, straightforward and open. The sides are at odds over everything from trade and technology to human rights, self-governing Taiwan and the South China Sea.
In some of his most pointed comments, Xi said ‘Taiwanese independence forces’ and those in the US who would use them to contain China were the key sources of tension over the island that China claims as its own territory. ‘We have patience and are willing to show utmost sincerity and exert the greatest efforts to obtain peaceful unification,’ Xi said, according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency. ‘However, if the Taiwan independence separatist forces provoke and force our hand, we will be required to take drastic measures.’
The softened rhetoric marks a major improvement. What benefits accrue depends on whether the two countries (US and China) can find areas of cooperation and come up with agreements, work-arounds or other ways of managing their disputes.

IIT-Madras team develops new approach for accurate detection,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/12/iit-madras-team-develops-new-approach-for-accurate-detection/,"November 12, 2021",NT Bureau,Technology,"Chennai: Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) researchers have developed a new approach for accurate detection of earthquakes.
The proposed solution results in accurate detection and picking of the first waves in earthquake signals, which provide a small lead time and enable measures to save lives.
An estimate of accurate time of arrival of non-destructive waves of earthquakes would not only help in developing a robust Early Warning System, but also gives a lead time of approximately 30 seconds to two minutes (range may vary primarily depending on the distance of epicentre location from the monitoring site or plant) till the destructive surface waves hit the ground.
‘This lead time, though appearing small, is sufficient to shut down the nuclear reactors, transportation such as metro and to park the elevators in high rise building at the nearest floor, among numerous other measures that can save countless lives’, a release from IIT-M said.
This research was undertaken by Kanchan Aggarwal (First Author), PhD Scholar, IIT-M, under the guidance of Prof.Arun K Tangirala, Department of Chemical Engineering. The findings of their research were published in the reputed peer-reviewed open access scientific journal Plos One.
The research was partially funded by the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, an advisory body of the Department of Atomic Energy.
Highlighting the practical applications of this research and how it could be taken to the field, Prof. Arun Tangirala said the proposed framework is not necessarily limited to the detection of seismic events, but is generic and can be used for fault detection and isolation in other domains as well.
Furthermore, the framework can incorporate any predictive models including the Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, which will reduce the human intervention in the detection, he said.

British PM to return to COP26 to urge action,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/10/british-pm-to-return-to-cop26-to-urge-action/,"November 10, 2021",Agency,Technology,"Boris Johnson
London: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is heading back to COP26 to press negotiators from around the world to turn promises into action in the summit’s closing days.
Johnson attended a world leaders’ summit that kicked off the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow last week, and will return to the Scottish city Wednesday.
So far the conference has produced headline-grabbing announcements in areas including ending coal power, funding green technology and reversing deforestation. But the almost 200 nations attending remain far from sealing a deal that could limit global warming to the internationally agreed goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.
Johnson’s office says issues still being hammered out include ”a common time frame for national commitments on emissions reductions and agreed methodology for countries to report on their climate action” — mechanisms that can be used to hold countries to their commitments.
There is also an unkept promise from rich nations to give more money to the countries most vulnerable to climate change — often developing nations that have done least to cause it.
Johnson, along with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, will meet with government officials, negotiators and civil society groups in an attempt to inject momentum into the talks.
Johnson said climate change ‘is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people. We need to pull out all the stops if we’re going to keep 1.5C within our grasp.’ COP26 is due to end Friday, though the talks could stretch on longer.

Ruling that the government does not get a free pass every time the spectre of national security is raised, the Supreme Court appointed the committee comprising three technical members and supervised by its retired judge Justice R V Raveendran to conduct a ‘thorough inquiry’ into allegations of use of Pegasus software for unauthorised surveillance.
Justice Raveendran will be assisted in this task by Alok Joshi, former IPS officer (1976 batch) and Sundeep Oberoi, Chairman, Sub Committee in (International Organisation of Standardisation/International Electro-Technical Commission/Joint Technical Committee). The three technical members of the committee are Naveen Kumar Chaudhary, Professor (Cyber Security and Digital Forensics) and Dean, National Forensic Sciences University, Gandhinagar, Gujarat; Prabaharan P, Professor (School of Engineering), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, Kerala; and Ashwin Anil Gumaste, Institute Chair Associate Professor (Computer Science and Engineering), Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Maharashtra.
Chief Justice NV Ramana began the judgment with a quote from George Orwell’s 1984 -‘If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.’
The order noted that various petitions in the case had been filed by direct victims. Justice should not only be done but should be seen to be done, said the Supreme Court.
‘This court gave ample time to the Centre to disclose all information regarding the Pegasus attack since 2019. However only a limited affidavit was filed throwing no light. If the Centre made its stand clear the burden on us would have been less,’ said the Chief Justice.
The Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta had submitted that the government can’t be compelled to disclose whether it is using a particular software for surveillance, as it could alert terror groups. The SG had asserted this issue cannot be made a subject matter of affidavit or public discussion, and instead suggested that a committee constituted by the Union Government itself can examine the allegations of targeted surveillance of activists, journalists, politicians etc., using the Pegasus spyware."

IIT Madras researchers design white light emitters,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/19/iit-madras-researchers-design-white-light-emitters/,"October 19, 2021",NT Bureau,Technology,"The IIT-M team behind the latest research.
Chennai: Indian Institute of Technology Madras Researchers have successfully developed a white light emitter for use in LEDs. The development of energy-efficient Light Emitting Diodes or LEDs replaced the energy-inefficient incandescent lamps in lighting and display applications.
While LEDs have been available in almost all colours, white LEDs are a more recent development. Conventional LED materials cannot emit white light and specialised techniques such as coating blue LED with yellow phosphor and combining blue, green, and red LEDs, have been used to produce white light. There has been a worldwide search for materials that can directly emit white light rather than through these indirect techniques that can cause loss of efficiency.
The innovation has been patented by the researchers and was recently granted the Government of India’s ‘SERB-Technology Translation Award.’ The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) provides financial assistance to researchers, academic institutions, research and development laboratories, industrial concerns, and other agencies. The team proposes to use the grant money of Rs 30 lakh to produce LEDs using their distorted perovskite materials.
The research was led by Dr. Aravind Kumar Chandiran, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras, and Prof. Ranjit Kumar Nanda B., Department of Physics, IIT Madras.
Apart from the patent, the results of this research work have been published in the prestigious peer-reviewed International journal belonging to the Nature group – Communications Materials.
The research paper was co-authored by Dr. Tamilselvan Appadurai, Ravi Kashikar, Poonam Sikarwar, Dr. Sudhadevi Antharjanam, Dr. Ranjit Kumar Nanda B. and Dr. Aravind Kumar Chandiran
Explaining the practical applications of this Research, Dr. Aravind Kumar Chandiran, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras, said, ‘The indigenously-developed bright white light emitters can potentially replace the conventional high-cost materials and phenomenally save the energy cost per lumens.’
Touching on the future of their discovery, Dr. Aravind Kumar Chandiran added, ‘We believe that our work contributes to Government of India’s ‘Make in India’ programme and we hope to become a technology leader in light emitters in the near future.’
In their Communications Materials Research Paper, the researchers, in addition to reporting the details of the specific perovskite material, have also proposed a clear design strategy that scientists can employ to develop white light emitters.
Highlighting the impact this research could have in the field, Prof. Ranjit Kumar Nanda B., Department of Physics, IIT Madras, said, ‘Tuning the distortion at the atomic level to extract white light will motivate perovskite community to explore this topic much deeper.’
The IIT Madras team has been exploring crystalline materials called ‘Halide-Perovskites’ for various applications due to their extraordinary optoelectronic properties and excellent light-to-current conversion efficiencies.

The modelling shows a clear, actionable pathway to achieve a net zero electricity system that can bring enormous environmental and economic benefits to India, one of the world’s largest and fastest growing economies:
Increasing renewable energy from 25 per cent today to 100 per cent before 2050 cuts the cost of India’s electricity by 48 per cent, from $88 USD per megawatt hour in 2020, to $46 USD in 2050, it said.
A flexible 100 per cent renewable system provides large levels of excess power that can address India’s rising energy dependency, forecast to double by 2030.
Increasing renewable energy could also generate major new revenues from hydrogen production, creating a technology market worth $39.8 billion USD.
The modelling makes a clear case for immediate action to accelerate the development of a 100 per cent renewable energy system in India.

Editorial: Digital dreams,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/16/editorial-digital-dreams/,"October 16, 2021",NT Bureau,Technology,"Covid-19 pandemic forced an inevitable shift to digital payments but Indians continue to have a strong bias for cash payments, a latest report said.
Due to the emergence of disruptive technologies leading to technology led payment solutions, there is a need to reassess the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSS), a key enabler for promoting digital transactions, according to the report by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.
The Act was enacted more than a decade back when the digital payments market in India was at its nascent stage and the law was primarily enacted to regulate payment systems from a systemic perspective and to confer the RBI with necessary powers to regulate these systems, it stated. While the RBI has time and again sought to address the existing gaps in the primary law through directions issued from time to time, this may not be the optimal regulatory or policy response, it added.
Such an approach is also not in line with the international best practices where several countries have, along with policy interventions, undertaken efforts to modernise their payments law to adapt to the rapidly evolving industry, it said and recommended that India needs to reassess the PSS Act taking into account the developments in the retail payments sector since its enactment and the future of digital payments in India. It suggested a renewed retail payment services law (Proposed Law) for India built on the principles of proportionate regulation to tap the full potential of retail digital payments. Technology should reach all and everyone should get access to digital tools.

Chennai: Researchers of Indian Institute of Technology Madras are developing data-driven strategies to enhance road Safety in Tamilnadu. Towards this, a one-day workshop on developing an action plan was organised recently by Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science at RBG Labs, IIT Madras, in coordination with the National Health Mission.
Various stakeholders involved in road safety include the Police, Health, Transport, Road owning agencies, Education, Rural Development, and Local Self Government, among others, participated in the workshop held at IIT Madras Research Park.
The outcomes of this workshop will be used to help a focused action plan and be used as a policy advisory to help reduce road accidents and fatalities in Tamilnadu.
Conveying his message for the workshop, Health Minister Ma Subramanian, said, ‘This workshop is the first of many such design-thinking based strategizing workshops for road safety. This coordinated knowledge sharing session among all the road safety stakeholders in Tamilnadu will be a pathway to continuously evolve successful road safety policies in the State.’
The key outcomes envisaged from this program include: Clear long term policies and strategies for moving towards an ‘accident-free Tamilnadu’, Short term strategies to improve road safety and minimise road traffic accidents during the next three months, Action Points and Key Performance Indicators for each of the Stakeholder Departments, including Health, Police,
Road owning agencies, Transport, Education and Local Bodies, Modalities for sharing and utilizing the data available with Stakeholder departments for collective action in ensuring road safety.
For example, Grid Analysis data available with Health Departments shall be used for enforcement, preventive action awareness creation, among others, by the stakeholder departments concerned.
Elaborating on this engagement, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian, Faculty In-Charge, Center of Excellence for Human Factors and Safety Science at RBG Labs, IIT Madras, who coordinated the workshop, said, ‘Avoiding accidents and fatalities in accidents is an essential requirement to be a developed nation. Roads are shared assets and the safety on them is a collective responsibility of all the stakeholders.’
Further, Prof. Venkatesh Balasubramanian said, ‘We have been advocating a data-driven systems approach to road safety through our Transportation Safety Framework (TSF) to have a holistic improvement. While TN has been performing well on reducing the fatalities from road accidents, in 2021, after the lockdown there has been a steady increase in fatality. Therefore, it is
quintessential to develop a good strategy based on data to address this on a priority basis. It is, therefore, necessary to have a design thinking approach to solve the problem by not just identifying the issues but implementing changes that are sustainable in the local conditions.’
In 2020, Tamilnadu became the first State in India and globally, the only administered territory to have achieved a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of reducing deaths due to road accidents by 50 per cent. However, there has been a steady increase in the number of road fatalities in 2021.

WHO to vaccinate 40% population of every nation soon,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/08/who-to-vaccinate-40-population-of-every-nation-soon/,"October 8, 2021",Agency,Technology,"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
Geneva: The World Health Organization (WHO) announced an initiative to vaccinate 40 per cent of the population of every country against Covid-19 by the end of 2021 and 70 per cent by mid-2022, by prioritising vaccine delivery to low-income countries, particularly those in Africa.
Today, the WHO is launching the Strategy to Achieve Global Covid-19 Vaccination by mid-2022, Xinhua news agency quoted WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as saying at a press briefing here on Thursday.
The strategy outlines the road we must all take together to achieve our targets of vaccinating 40 per cent of the population of every country by the end of this year, and 70 percent by the middle of next year.
According to Tedros, achieving these targets will require at least 11 billion vaccine doses, which is an allocation problem instead of a supply problem.
With global vaccine production now at nearly 1.5 billion doses per month, there is enough supply to achieve our targets, provided they are distributed equitably, he said.
According to the WHO’s records, more than 6.4 billion vaccine doses have now been administered globally, and almost one-third of the world’s population is fully vaccinated against the virus.
However, low-income countries have received less than half of one percent of the world’s vaccines.
In Africa, less than 5 per cent of people are fully vaccinated. Earlier this year, the WHO had set a target for all countries to vaccinate 10 per cent of their populations by the end of September, but 56 countries didn’t make it.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who joined the WHO chief at the initiatve’s launch, said: “Vaccine inequality is the best ally of the Covid-19 pandemic.
But through dose sharing, swaps, technology transfers and other priority actions, it is possible to reduce deaths and minimize suffering, prevent health systems from being overwhelmed, resume social and economic activities, and reduce the risk of dangerous new variants.
The UN chief also renewed his appeal to the G20 nations for help, adding that their meeting later this month will be an opportunity to deliver.
I urge all global stakeholders to step up, mobilize their resources and turn this strategy into a reality, he said.

Pests keep on evolving to survive and try to attack the plants and especially crops. Plants on the other hand, develop their own defence mechanisms to keep these pests at bay. The genes responsible for these defence mechanisms either can be present in the crop plants itself, their wild relatives or in other organisms which are sexually non-compatible.
In some crops, there are no or very limited genes which can provide resistance. Cotton is a major example, in which host genes for resistance against cotton pests are not there.
Therefore, development of transgenic Bt cotton which provide resistance against major bollworms has provided a major relief to farmers for more than two decades, said a statement.

New Delhi: Majority of the Indian media and entertainment companies are of the opinion that they must reinvent themselves to navigate the technological disruptions impacting the industry, says a report by EY.
About 52 per cent executives from the media and entertainment sector in India believe they can no longer rely on traditional business models, if they are to remain future relevant, said the report titled ‘How are media and entertainment businesses reinventing in an age of transformation?’ Moreover, one third of them recognise upskilling of the existing workforce as the key to talent development to meet the changing industry demands, it added.
While, 21 per cent admit their businesses need to reinvigorate, but are unsure what actions to prioritise, said the report which is based on a survey of 350 industry leaders from around the world, which also includes 29 from India. ‘While 52 per cent Indian M&E executives realised that their traditional business models were not reliable in the long run, yet just 24 per cent of Indian executives felt that their companies would cease to exist without innovation, demonstrating their confidence that traditional media will survive in the future,’ the report said.
It further said: ‘Many Indian executives cited the multiplicity of options available to invest in digital media as confusing, and one in five executives were unclear on how to prioritize their digital investments, particularly given the long break even periods required.’ ‘The question of whether to focus on content production for immediate gains versus building direct to customer and platform/data capabilities was a key area of discussion,’ it added.
According to it, almost one in two Indian executives felt the pressure to ‘maximise short-term results as a barrier to innovation,’ which also reflected in just one in three Indian executives believing in upskilling of their existing workforce. The survey also highlights ‘a sense of perplexity’ among media and entertainment businesses, with 28 per cent indicating the need to reinvigorate their business, without thorough knowledge of what aspects to prioritise."

The company also announced a suite of streaming devices including set-top-box for watching content available on the Airtel Xstream app, formerly Airtel TV, on television sets and desktops. Bharti Airtel expects the new platform to provide its inroads in the market when 5G services are rolled out in the country.
“5G will start taking over broadband connections in many areas. As we enter 5G era, these are all IoT devices. They are able to connect to 5G networks now and stream high-end content. Think this as preparation for future while it is a sensible decision for today’s market,” Bharti Airtel chief product officer, Adarsh Nair said after launching the platform.
The Airtel Xstream app comes bundled with entertainment streaming applications including ZEE5, Hooq, Hoi Choi, Eros Now, HungamaPlay, ShemarooMe, Ultra and Curiosity Stream, as well as songs from Wynk app.

“There are 18 million broadband homes. This number is going up every day. There is an opportunity to put these devices in 18 million homes. Most of the OTT (over-the-top) content providers have optimised their services which means you don’t require very data speeds.

The podcast hosted by Sarah Koenig? Variety reported that it has been downloaded 340 million times! For the uninitiated, the non-fiction audio series investigates the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee.
Ever since Serial stormed our phones, the podcast market changed ever since. The thirst to consume audio series continues to thrive. According to a recent media report, ‘By 2020, world podcast industry will reach $20 billion and the medium continues to become popular in India.’
* Love thy pod
What makes a podcast different is that you ‘see’ scenes folding up in your ‘mind’. You completely reply on your ears. If it is an audio drama, you hear characters speak along with intense sound effects like footsteps, shuffle of the keys while opening a door, sound of fabric stretching as they settle on seats, rumble of the wind, howl of a storm, boots grinding over snow filled roads, you hear it all. And not to forget, the gripping background music. If movies have visual effects to grab our attention, then hands down a podcasts’ sound effects is the heart and soul.
There are so many shows to listen. Most of the popular shows are available for free here. Apple Podcast and Google Podcast is the best choice of Apple and Android phone users. Here are two podcasts to consider.
* Modern Love
For beginners, who wish to listen feel good stories, then try ‘Modern Love‘, a podcast based on essays published in the New York Times and read by Hollywood stars. Hosted by Meghna Chakrabarti, each episode includes short interviews with essayists. It is emotionally powerful, beautiful narrated with a serene tone. There is a perfect sync between the essay’s theme and voice actors.
Like for example, in the episode, ‘Misery Loves Fried Chicken’ read by William Jackson Harper, about two friends who cling on to each other following a bitter breakup. ‘When the movie ended, we shuffled outside with the rest of the Saturday night date crowd: handsome boys and coltish girls dressed in shorts and T-shirts,’ reads William. ‘They wandered outside, laughing and smiling, blissfully unaware of the dangers they courted. Would they still be happy and smiling in a year’s time, knowing as we did that to love is to risk great unhappiness?’ To listen such deep words together with soul stirring background music makes you pause for a moment, asking for more.
* Marvel’s Wolverine
Wolverine: We have seen this grim, short tempered superhero with claws storming the screens of the X-Men universe for over 20 years. But imagine listening to his story. The show, ‘Wolverine‘ is Marvel’s first scripted podcast produced by Marvel New Media and Stitcher.
  With voice of Richard Armitage (Remember the actor who played as Thorin Oakenshield in Hobbit Series?) in the titular role, we follow in season one, ‘Wolverine: The Long Night’, two federal agents investigating a series of murders in the fictional town of Burns, Alaska. Logan aka Wolverine is the main suspect. The series has a top class sound affects with a formulaic plot perfectly sandwiched by an eerie background music and wonderful voice performance. Now, season two, ‘Wolverine: The Lost Trail’ continues to entertain fans."

Instead you drop at a theatre to watch Basha! (Obviously, this means you are a hardcore Rajini fan!).
While returning home, you meet with an accident. You bang your head and fall into a coma for over 20 years! And then you wake up one day, the world has change, and you decide to deliver the letters again.
While delivering a letter at a home, you meet face to face with a serial killer! In a nutshell, this is the plot of the all new ten-episode Zee5 web series, Postman, directed by Prashanth Gunasekaran and produced Sameer Bharat Ram, starring Munishkanth in the lead role. Edited by Mathivathnan JA, the web series has its music by Vijay and Vicky.
The first two episodes was screened to media here in the city. Munishkanth plays the role of Raja, a postman who is a diehard Rajini fan (He even names his daughter as Rajini, depicted by newbie star Keerthi Pandian). Together, the father-daughter duo decide to deliver letters. But things do not go the way they expect as mystery and suspense clouds their journey.
Sameer Bharath speaking to media said, “The idea of what may happen to the life of a man after waking up from coma for over twenty years inspired us to make the shoot the story right away.” He added, “We reached out to many mainstream actors to portray the role of the postman.

Melbourne: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said the government would rebate visa fees for international students and backpackers to support the workforce challenge amid surging Covid-19 cases nationwide.
Those include international students who arrive in Australia over the next eight weeks and backpackers who arrive within 12 weeks, Xinhua news agency reported.
And there are around 150,000 students who have visas who we are encouraging to come back to be there for the start of their university or college year, he told reporters in Canberra.
But we also want them to come here and be able to be filling some of these critical workforce shortages, particularly those who are working and being trained in health care, aged care, those types of sectors, he said.
Australia on Wednesday reported more than 70,000 locally-acquired coronavirus infections and more than 60 deaths, according to health department figures from states and territories.
The latest data make it the second deadliest day of coronavirus pandemic in Australia after more than 70 deaths were reported on Tuesday.
A poll published by Nine Entertainment newspapers on Wednesday found that an overwhelming majority of Australians want the federal government to subsidize rapid antigen tests (RATs) for Covid-19.
The Resolve Political Monitor found that 86 per cent of voters believe RATs should be free or subsidised in some way.
Morrison said despite the increasing number of cases and staff shortfalls in critical supply chains, Australia was doing better than almost any other country in the world in the fight against Omicron.
When it comes to even the large number of more than 350 deaths in the course of the past week, our death rate that relates to Omicron is one of the lowest in the world, he said.

Holding banners reading, Let us eat and Give us our frozen money, the protesters chanted slogans and marched down a central avenue, with the ruling Taliban providing security.
International funding to Afghanistan has been suspended and billions of dollars of the country’s assets abroad, mostly in the United States, were frozen after the Taliban took control of the country in mid-August.
The lack of funding has battered Afghanistan’s already troubled economy, leading to increasing poverty while aid groups warn of a looming humanitarian catastrophe. State employees, from doctors to teachers and administrative civil servants, haven’t been paid in months. Banks, meanwhile, have restricted how much money account holders can withdraw.
No country has yet officially recognised the country’s new Taliban rulers due to the armed group’s previous track record. The Taliban’s previous regime 20 years ago banned women and girls from education and public life, mandated beards for men and attendance at prayers, banned sports and entertainment and carried out public executions. But current Taliban government officials say their rule will be different, including eventually allowing education for all girls, and have called on the international community to release funds and help stave off a humanitarian disaster.

While working in other regional movies, I felt that respective movie should have released in Tamil, and when reading the script of this film, I strongly felt the same. Later, I was surprised to see the producer announce that he is making the film in Tamil as well, and I was so happy about it. The film will give an experience of an exact Tamil movie.

Seoul: South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday apologised to the nation for restoring tough social distancing measures following a spike in coronavirus cases and deaths.
Moon issued the apology shortly after the government announced new measures to reduce the maximum private gathering size to four people and restore a 9 p.m. curfew on restaurant and cafe business hours, reports Yonhap News Agency.
I am sorry that we have had to once again strengthen antivirus measures, Moon was quoted as saying by his spokesperson Park Kyung-mee.
Over the course of the phased return to normal, we failed to suppress the increase in critically ill patients and failed to prepare sufficiently, including in terms of securing hospital beds, he said, according to Park.
The President promised to bring the situation under control as much as possible during the period that the virus curbs will be in place, or from Saturday until January 2, 2022.
He especially pledged a swift decision on providing financial compensation to small business owners and self-employed people who are likely to be among the hardest hit by the curbs.
Under the new measures, the use of restaurants and cafes will be restricted to up to four vaccinated people per visit. Those who have not been vaccinated will be able to use the facilities alone or request take-out or delivery.
Bars, nightclubs and other entertainment venues will also be subject to the 9 p.m. curfew, while movie theatres, concert halls and internet cafes will be able to operate until 10 p.m.
The differentiation is based on the extent to which masks can be worn and whether there is eating inside.
The measures represent a sharp reversal of the government’s “living with Covid-19” scheme under which all business curfews were lifted, while the cap on private gatherings was raised considerably before being lowered again to six in the capital area and eight elsewhere in the country as of last week.
The abrupt change comes as South Korea has seen a surge in coronavirus infections, along with the number of critical cases and Covid-19 deaths.
Daily case numbers have been approaching the 8,000s, while fatalities hit an all-time high of 94 on Tuesday.

Digital World Acquisition, which is often referred to by its trading symbol of “DWAC,” said it is cooperating with ”the preliminary, fact-finding inquiries” by the Financial Industry Regulation Authority and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Financial Industry Regulation Authority, or FINRA, asked in late October and early November for a review of trading in DWAC’s stock before the Oct. 20 merger deal was announced. That announcement sent the stock surging from USD 9.96 to USD 94.20 in just two days as Trump supporters and investors looking to make a fast buck piled in. The shares have since pulled back to roughly USD 43.
The Securities and Exchange Commission made a request in early November for documents related to meetings of DWAC’s board, trading policies and other things. According to DWAC, the SEC’s request said the commission’s “investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of DWAC or any person, event, or security.” DWAC said over the weekend that it has lined up USD 1 billion in promised investments for the former president’s new venture from a group of unnamed institutional investors, and it filed a copy of the presentation used to pitch investors and analysts.
The presentation included forecasts that the company’s Truth Social service may have 81 million users by 2026, or nearly 7 million more people than voted for Trump in the last U.S. presidential election.
In five years, Trump Media is forecast to generate nearly USD 3.7 billion in revenue, according to the filing. That is more than the annual revenue of retailer Restoration Hardware, RV maker Winnebago Industries and entertainment giant iHeart Media, which owns more than 800 radio stations.
DWAC was shaky in Monday morning trading following the filing. It opened with a slight gain before falling to a 2.2 per cent loss.

The PMK leader had announced a cash reward of Rs one lakh to anyone who would attack the actor, when he visits the district.
Palanisamy was booked under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant, thereby causing danger of riot), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 505 (statements conducting to public mischief), and 506 (1)
(criminal intimidation). He is yet to be arrested, police sources said.
The PMK functionary along with party cadres stormed into a theatre here on Sunday, where Suriya-starrer ‘Vel’ movie was screened, and stopped its screening.
Meanwhile, armed police protection was given to the actor’s house in Chennai, following the threat, though he did not seek protection from the police.
Suriya’s film has come under criticism and attack from Vanniyar Sangam, which accused the actor of maligning the community.
The Vanniyar Sangam had sent a legal notice to Suriya, his wife actor Jyothika of 2D Entertainment, film director T J Gnanvel and Amazon Prime Video demanding removal of the community’s symbol of the raging fire pot from the movie and sought an apology for damning, tarnishing and damaging the reputation of the community.
Besides, the Sangam also sought Rs five crore damages, which should be paid within a period of seven days from the time and date of receipt of the notice.
The controversial move was based on the real life custodial death of an innocent man, namely Rajakannu from the Irular tribe. Suriya played the role inspired by Justice (Retired) K.Chandru, who appeared for the case as a lawyer in 1993.
The character of a cop, who tortured Rajakannu in the police lockup has been deliberately depicted as belonging to the Vanniyar caste, the Vanniyar Sangam alleged in its complaint to the police and demanded action against the actor.
Meanwhile, popular film personalities including directors Bharathiraja, Vetrimaran, Pa.Ranjith, Venkat Prabhu and Lokesh Kanagaraj have voiced their support for Suriya.

Over the years everyone kept asking me whether we would be coming back with a sequel, and I always knew that I had to bring the epic franchise back to the audience, but I believe everything has its own right time. After changing my mind a million times on how to proceed with the story, and eventually working very hard to convert this vision into reality with the support of all my cast and crew, I am now ready to bring this film to our audiences, and we can’t wait to hear their reactions. Joining forces with Amazon Prime Video is just icing on the cake for all of us."

Rana Daggubati to be the face of WWE campaign,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/02/rana-daggubati-to-be-the-face-of-wwe-campaign/,"November 2, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Rana Daggubati, who attained national fame after he played the villain in ‘Baahubali’, is the face of an upcoming WWE campaign in Tamil, Telugu, and English.
WWE, or World Wrestling Entertainment, headed by bodybuilder-wrestler-showman-TV mogul Vince McMahon, is the world’s No. 1 purveyor of professional wrestling on television. It has been the nursery of international celebrity wrestlers such as Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and John Cena.
At a shoot recently at the Railway Sports Complex, Secunderabad, Daggubati posed for the upcoming WWE campaign, which will be aired on Sony Ten 4. The actor, incidentally, was the face of the Sony Ten 4 channels when they were launched. The channel airs sports programmes, including pro wrestling and mixed martial arts (MMA), in Tamil and Telugu.
On the sets of the campaign shoot, Daggubati was spotted donning a WWE championship title and interacting with a group of children. He also posed on a Harley Davidson and performed stunts with ropes. Pictures from the shoot have now gone viral.
Commenting on the campaign, the actor said, “I can say that it will strike a chord with our native viewers.” A representative from Sony Sports added: “WWE is one of the most viewed properties on the sports channels in India and has a strong following in Tamil- and Telugu-speaking markets. Rana’s love of sports and WWE is well-documented in the public domain. So, Rana Daggubati is the ideal choice to front the campaign.”
Daggubati will soon be seen with Sai Pallavi and Priyamani in the upcoming Telugu movie ‘Virata Parvam’, which is centred around the Naxalite movement in Telangana."
Suriya’s generous act,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/11/02/suriyas-generous-act/,"November 2, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Chief Minister MK Stalin lauded actor Suriya for donating Rs one crore for the students of the Irular community.
Suriya tweeted: ‘I’m deeply touched and running out of words. The intention of Jai Bhim has been fulfilled with the emotional note of the Honourable Chief Minister. On behalf of the entire Jai Bhim team, my hearty thanks to our Chief Minister’.
Directed by TJ Gnanavel, Jai Bhim is now available on Amazon Prime Video. Jai Bhim stars Suriya, Lijomol Jose and Manikandan in lead roles. Prakash Raj, Rajisha Vijayan, Jayaprakash and Rao Ramesh play supporting roles in the film. The film is produced by Suriya and Jyotika’s 2D Entertainment.
Earlier, Suriya and Jyotika donated Rs 1 crore to Pazhankudi Irular Education Trust ahead of Jai Bhim release. The cheque was presented to Stalin."
Suriya’s message for fans,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/30/suriyas-message-for-fans/,"October 30, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Suriya starreer Jai Bhim will be out exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on 2 November.
While talking about how Jai Bhim was one of the most challenging films of his career, Suriya said, ‘It’s been close to 24 years that I have been working in the industry. We have seen a lot of highs and lows, but my fans and movie lovers have always stood by me. They’ve really had a lot of trust and they have put in a lot of belief in me. This trust that they have placed upon me has built a beautiful relationship between me and them. I only want to give back this love by doing good films.’
Adding further to the experience of working in Jai Bhim and his role as Advocate Chandru, Suriya added, ‘This film is not in my comfort zone. It does not fall into the layout or pattern or sketch that any of my previous films were. The whole pattern, storytelling, or the actors involved, the emotions in it, will be a little intense. It’s just not entertainment, but it will definitely move and impact you. The recall factor after watching this film, I’m sure will be remembered for a long time. It is definitely a huge responsibility but a good one to take on. I just want to deliver better films for my audience.’
I got to meet Justice Chandru sir, much before the film through Tha.Se. Gnanavel. We were told he’s a disruptor, he’s a change maker and we had heard a lot of inspirational stories about him. We also got to know that he never charges any money for human rights cases, reveals Suriya and continues, ‘Knowing Chandru sir more and reading about his books and him in his younger days, we all thought that his story has to reach every corner of the world. People like Justice Chandru Sir are unsung heroes and we thought we must share his story and ignite younger minds, and this case was a remarkable one. Another interesting fact about ‘Jai Bhim’ is that a High Court setting has not been done before, at least in the recent Tamil films. So, all of these things highly motivated me to choose ‘Jai Bhim’ as the project where I want to play a lawyer for the first time.
‘Jai Bhim is a thought-provoking story based on true events that happened in the 1990s in Tamilnadu. It is written and directed by Tha. Se. Gnanavel and features popular actor Suriya in the lead along with Prakash Raj, Rao Ramesh, Rajisha Vijayan, Manikandan, and Lijo Mol Jose in pivotal roles. Jai Bhim has been produced by Jyotika and Suriya under the banner of 2D Entertainment. Co-produced by Rajsekar Karpoorasundarapandian, Jai Bhim has music by Sean Rolden. The team behind this film also includes DOP SR Kadhir, Editor Philominraj, and Art Director Kadhir."

Editorial: Virus worries,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/27/editorial-virus-worries/,"October 27, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"At a time when Covid-19 cases are coming down across the world, their rise in some countries is causing worry. The daily number of Covid deaths in Russia hit another high Tuesday amid a surge in infections that has forced the Kremlin to order most Russians to stay off work starting this week.
Sluggish vaccination rates have allowed the virus to spread quickly across Eastern Europe. Ukraine and Bulgaria also reported record daily death tolls on Tuesday. Russia’s national coronavirus task force reported 1,106 deaths in 24 hours, the most since the start of the pandemic. The number brought the country’s official pandemic death toll to 232,775, Europe’s highest by far.
Russia registered 36,446 new daily coronavirus cases, slightly fewer than the past few days. In a move intended to stem the spread of the virus, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a nonworking period between Oct. 30 and Nov. 7, when the country will observe an extended holiday.
During that time, most state organizations and private businesses are to suspend operations, and most stores will close along with kindergartens, schools, gyms and most entertainment venues. Restaurants and cafes will only be open for takeout or delivery. Food stores, pharmacies and businesses operating key infrastructure can stay open.
China on Tuesday placed Lanzhou, a city of four million under lockdown in a bid to stamp out a domestic coronavirus spike. The authorities asked residents of the city not to leave home except extreme emergencies. The restrictions came as China reported 29 new domestic infections — including six cases in Lanzhou, the provincial capital of northwestern province Gansu. Officials in Lanzhou said the ‘entry and exit of residents’ would be strictly controlled and limited to essential supplies or medical treatment.
‘All types of residential communities are to implement closed management,’ authorities said in a statement. The latest rules come on top of strict stay-at-home orders imposed on tens of thousands in northern China, with access to tourist sites already limited and residents advised not to leave the city unless necessary. The spread of virous should be controlled at any cost as the world cannot afford another wave.

Nivin Pauly gets ready for Padavettu,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/21/nivin-pauly-gets-ready-for-padavettu/,"October 21, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Saregama’s Studio arm Yoodlee films has come on board as producers for the Malayalam film Padavettu.  Co- Produced with Sunny Wayne, the film written and directed by Liju Krishna will star the acclaimed actor Nivin Pauly.
Siddharth Anand Kumar, Vice President, Films at Saregama India, says, “)’Padavettu is a strong narrative about an underdog’s awakening to his true potential when pitted against circumstances. Given the amazing work being done by Nivin and the unique directorial vision of Liju Krishna, ‘Padavettu’ is a story that we are excited to produce. Yoodlee Films is aggressively looking at producing a spate of regional content in the coming months, and the inclusion of this film in our slate with such an illustrious team is a matter of great pride for us.’
Director Liju Krishna says, ‘Padavettu is a political drama relevant to our times. It endeavours to portray the relentless pursuit of the layman, the oppressed section of society who is in a constant struggle and fight to reclaim their unique identity and rightful place in a world meant for all! Padavettu visualises the aspirations, pain and joy of life in an idyllic village in North Kerala. The fact that the film has many locals performing in it with due support from the villagers makes Padavettu truly a film from the people, by the people and for the people.’
Co-Producer Sunny Wayne says, ‘The fact that accomplished production houses like Yoodlee Films are now backing Malayalam cinema is a testament to the fact that the Malayalam industry is rapidly growing and increasingly gaining pan-India prominence with due support from OTT platforms who are now betting big on Malayalam films.’
Multi-award-winning superstar Nivin Pauly is going through an intense physical transformation for the role in Padavettu. Nivin believes that borderless synergies are the future of entertainment and says, “Padavettu is a story that impacted me hugely when it was first narrated. It’s a story of second chances and finding the inner mettle to stand up against the wrong. I strongly believe that the storyline, emotions, and the beautiful portrayal of characters will connect well with the audience and earn the film a great reception widely .
Aditi Balan adds, ‘It is heartening to see Malayalam films claiming a pan-India following. The fact that Yoodlee is backing Malayalam cinema in such a significant way, is indicative that more such collaborations will become the norm.’
Siddharth concludes, As far as we are concerned, we look at India not just in terms of one but many film industries that can potentially win over the global audience. We also do not want to neglect digital content consumers in smaller towns who want to enjoy stories in their native languages. We believe that the next big set of audiences will emerge from there and so we want to produce content in various regional languages like Tamil, Punjabi, Malayalam, Marathi etc. There are unheard stories and an inexhaustible talent pool in every corner of India, and it would be myopic to limit content creation to just Hindi or one or two languages.
Padavettu has music by Govind Vasantha."

Review: Udanpirappe,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/15/review-udanpirappe/,"October 15, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"As the title suggests, it is the story of a deep bond between two siblings.  Written and directed by Era Saravanan and bankrolled by 2D Entertainment, the film features an ensemble cast including Jyotika, Sasikumar, Samuthirakani, Soori, and Kalaiyarasan among others. Interestingly it is Jyotika’s 50th venture on screen.
Udanpirappe is about Mathangi (Jyotika) caught between his brother Vairavan ( Sasikumar) and her husband Sargunam ( Samuthirakani). If the former feels anything can be done to ensure justice is meted out to an individual, the latter wants to go by law of the land for anything and everything. This leads to difference of opinion between Sargunam and Vairavan who stay away from each other. The onus is on Jyotika tp get the two cone together. Set in Pudukottai backdrop, credits to director for gathering guts to speak about water scarcity affecting people there. The dialogues at places are razor sharp. Also Saravanan, has ensured less spoken especially in emotional scenes would strengthen the content.
Jyotika does a good show. Her body language specially considering that she did very few rural movies is appreciable.  Her performance adds strength. Sasikumar as usual as a do-gooder and a devout family man pulls it off. Samuthirakani, does what he almost does in his other films. Soori, Kalaiyarasan, Naten form part of the cast. Cinematography is by Velra and he captures dry and barren land well. D Imman’s BGMs are good.
On the whole, Udanpirappe out in Amazon Prime is a decent watch."

KKR have virtually assured themselves of a play-offs berth in the IPL after their 86-run win over Rajasthan Royals on Thursday. They are set to play against the third-place team of the league phase in the Qualifier 1 on Sunday.
He (Russell) had a fitness test on Wednesday, and I think he’s just maybe a game away. So, I think he’d be pushing hard over the next few days to get back in for the final (play-offs), Hussey said at the post-match press conference on Thursday.
“(His availability) will be a huge boost not only for us but the competition. He’s world-class and he provides lots of entertainment.” With three play-offs spots already sealed by Delhi Capitals, Chennai Super Kings and Royals Challengers Bangalore, KKR consolidated their position for the fourth and final spot, finishing league engagements with 14 points from 14 games with an impressive net run rate of 0.587.
He admitted that there has been a change in fortunes for the KKR in the UAE after struggling in the Indian leg.
At the halfway mark, we weren’t playing the type of cricket that we wanted to play. We are all about playing entertaining cricket — hitting fours, sixes — and with the ball, hitting the stumps, taking wickets, and fielding exceptionally well.
So, the break probably did us a world of good — we got to refresh, recharge our batteries and re-plan — and come to Abu Dhabi. Abhishek Nayar did a great training session, all the boys got a lot of volume and (were) ready to go, explained Hussey on how the change occurred in the group. He credited head coach Brendon McCullum for the way KKR were playing."

Seemingly inspired by Aamir Khan’s Peepli Live, it tries to speak too many things at one go.
What begins as a search for the pet bulls by a poor couple in a dry village settles down as a political drama with preachy messages all through second half. The corrupt politicians, TRP driven media, innocent villagers who are not aware of their fundamental rights are talked in an elaborate manner. Here and there the GST, Hindi imposition and water scarcity are talked about.
Kunnimuthu (Mithun Manickam) and Veerayi (Ramya Pandian) live with their two bulls Karuppan and Vellaiyan. They treat them as their own kids. One day, the two bulls go missing and life comes to a standstill for them. Enters politics and media in their search.
Mithun Manickam does a decent job, while Ramya Pandian, is impressive. Vani Bhojan, plays a scribe convincingly. Music by Krish is okay while Sukumaran captures a dry village well.
Produced by 2D Entertainment, the movie has its moments but on the whole sounds preachy."

10D Cricket is a unique multi-player indoor family board game. It is a contest between bat and ball. There are six different dices (balls) with different results. There are various entries to determine the result of each ball. Players can decide the number of overs and wickets. 
  Abhinav Mukund said, ‘ The product in itself looks fantastic. The entire game is quite simple to play. The biggest thing that I have realised during the pandemic is that everyone has sort of gone into technology a lot more. There is not much time for people to sit around with your family and play. It’s a nice opportunity for kids and for adults to interact. ‘
‘I think the game in itself, Bagawati hasn’t compromised anything on the game. It clearly shows how the game has come out. It’s something that I would play. It’s an opportunity for all families to come together, even kids to come together instead of spending time on mobile phones…they can sit and enjoy a game of cricket on this board.’
‘Bagawati has involved a foundation (AndAlt Foundation). It’s a not for profit organisation which works towards finding solutions for people with disabilities. Most of it is done by people with disabilities and accessible livelihood for people with disabilities or disadvantaged communities. 
Basically what generally happens is because I know this a lot more…my wife is sort of involved with the disability sector…if you are an adult with disability in sort of rural India it could be very disadvantageous. AndAlt Foundation is doing a phenomenal job in creating opportunities for people with disabilities in rural Tamil Nadu, to grow, thrive and make sure they find employment and sustainable livelihood.’
‘One of the reasons why I accepted to come on board to launch this is because Bagawati is always aware of doing things like making sure people are involved, and make sure it’s inclusive for all. I wish Bagawati all success.’
RS Ramasaamy said, Fttingly it’s been launched by one of the finest cricketers Tamil Nadu has produced (Abhinav Mukund). I was quite fascinated by seeing the game and I’m sure the kids as well as the old people are going to enjoy this game. I’m sure it’s going to kindle the interest of the youngsters to take up this game…it’s already a cricket crazy nation and it’s going to be even more after playing this game.

Taliban bans IPL 2021,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/21/taliban-bans-ipl-2021/,"September 21, 2021",Agency,Entertainment,"Kabul: Fans of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021 in Afghanistan will have to give the T20 league a miss this season, as the new Taliban regime have banned it’s telecast. The IPL 2021 resumed in the United Arab Emirates – an Islamic state – on Sunday (September 19) with a game between Chennai Super Kings and defending champions Mumbai Indians.
The UAE leg of the IPL 2021 will not be telecast in Afghanistan due to possible ‘anti-Islam contents’ that could be aired during the programming. Afghanistan are now under the control of the Taliban regime.
Top Afghanistan cricketers like Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi and Mujeeb ur Rahman are taking part in IPL 2021. The Taliban have banned most forms of entertainment — including many sports – and women have been completely banned from playing sport. Former Afghanistan Cricket Board media manager and journalist, M Ibrahim Momand, sent out a tweet stating that due to possible anti-Islam content, girls dancing and the attendance of barred hair women in the Islamic Emirates of the Taliban, IPL broadcast is banned in the country.
Even though the hardline Islamists have shown they do not mind men playing cricket, pulling together a match in the capital Kabul shortly after foreign forces withdrew, Bashir Ahmad Rustamzai, Afghanistan’s new director-general for sports, had last week declined to answer as to whether women will be allowed to play sports — deferring it for top-level Taliban leaders to decide. The takeover has called into question the future of Afghanistan’s participation in Test matches, as under International Cricket Council regulations, nations must also have an active women’s team.
Earlier, Australia’s cricket chiefs threatened to cancel a historic maiden Test between the two countries — set to take place in November — after a senior Taliban official went on television to say it was ‘not necessary’ for women to play."

"Smartphones, screen time & self control",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/08/05/smartphones-screen-time-self-control/,"August 5, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Chennai: Smartphones and other smart devices have become a necessity for learning, working, shopping, finances, business, entertainment, events and more. While it has been helpful in many facets of life, the effects of smartphones, screen time and scrolling are many.
If left unaddressed, it can change the way we function and thrive as a race, both physically, emotionally and cognitively. City- based Psychologist & EQ Coach, Nivetha Raj addresses this concerning issue and shares ways to self-regulate.
Smartphones are undoubtedly fantastic tools, they make life easier with their multiple functions. However, extensive use of smartphones, increased screen time and endless scrolling are three red flags. Screen time takes up a significant part of our lives, imagine the amount of information, content, visuals, movement and colors you come across in a span of one minute. Let’s take a look at the impact of all this.
When the mind is exposed to an overload of information, it directly impacts key cognitive functions such as language, attention, memory, perception, learning and reasoning. That means it hampers our everyday productivity. The practice of texting/typing leads to stress onto our fingers and palms, which affects nervous system functioning and fine motor skills.
The monitor’s light affects the way our eyes perceive information. Increased screen time reduces the frequency of blinks, which is a leading cause for dry eyes. While the act of scrolling is easier, our mind gets overwhelmed as it attempts to consume an unrealistic amount of information in a fraction of a second. Social media apps have changed the way we foster relationships. This has impacted our feelings, expressions and perspectives.
A recent study showcased that teens across the world felt lonelier than ever before and one causative agent was the use of smartphones. Virtual communication has affected our language skills, with abbreviations, emojis, GIFs and auto-correct. Insomnia has been on the rise thanks to all the swiping and scrolling.
The mind is constantly overactive, hence it finds it harder to relax and shut down at the end of the day. Being glued to the screen increases the chances of a sedentary lifestyle, which underlies health issues. This is a just a brief look at the impact we are all living in. Here are some ways we can self-regulate as individuals to lessen these effects in our lives.
Self-regulating practices to limit screen time
Monitor your daily screen time, understand where you need to curb it. Aim for intentional use instead of mindless use. It’s easy to scroll for just a few minutes only to find that you’ve spent nearly an hour on your phone. Take digital detoxes. Avoid smartphones at least one hour before bedtime – unless you are using them for sleep time podcasts. Blink your eyes more often (intentionally) and exercise them. Don’t be actively engaged onto more than one device at a time.

"No plan to print currency notes, says FM",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/27/no-plan-to-print-currency-notes-says-fm/,"July 27, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Nirmala Sitharaman
New Delhi: The government has no plan to print currency notes to tide over the current economic crisis triggered by the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament on Monday.
To a question on whether there is any plan to print currency to tide over the crisis, the Finance Minister said, No Sir.
Many economists and experts have suggested the government to resort to printing more currency notes to support the economy ravaged by the spread of Covid-19, and protect jobs.
India’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have contracted by 7.3 per cent during 2020-21, Sitharaman said in a written reply to Lok Sabha.
This contraction reflects the unparalleled effect of the pandemic and the containment measures that were taken to control the pandemic, she said.
The fundamentals of the economy remain strong as gradual scaling back of lockdowns, along with the astute support of Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission has placed the economy firmly on the path of recovery from the second half of FY 2020-21, she said. The government had announced a special economic and comprehensive package of Rs 29.87 lakh crore under AtmaNirbhar Bharat (ANB) to combat the impact of the pandemic, to revive economic growth and to bolster employment during 2020-21, she said.
Meanwhile, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth is likely to be 8.8 to 9 per cent in the current financial year, driven by agriculture and industry sectors, Care Ratings said in a report. The country’s economy had contracted by 7.3 per cent in fiscal 2020-21.
The agency said the outlook for the Indian economy on almost all counts in FY22 would look seemingly better than FY21 on account of the negative base effect. “GDP growth for the year (FY22) is expected to be 8.8-9 per cent with GVA (gross value added) growth of 7.8 per cent. The main drivers of the economy would be agriculture and industry,” the ratings agency said in its Economic Outlook for 2021-22. Services sector will not be able to reach its potential even at 8.2 per cent growth as the second lockdown has affected sectors like hotels and restaurants, tourism, retail malls and entertainment in particular, it said.
While a lot has been done on the supply side by both the RBI and the government, the malaise is on the demand side which has been a problem even before the pandemic, Care Ratings pointed out. A critical factor this time will be the spending pattern of the rural households, the report said, adding that the monsoon forecast is good and ideally a stable Kharif harvest should bode well for rural incomes.

"Europe’s summer tourism outlook dimmed by variants, rules",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/26/europes-summer-tourism-outlook-dimmed-by-variants-rules/,"July 26, 2021",Agency,Entertainment,"London: Chaos and confusion over travel rules and measures to contain new virus outbreaks are contributing to another cruel summer for Europe’s battered tourism industry.
Popular destination countries are grappling with surging Covid-19 variants, but the patchwork and last-minute nature of the efforts as the peak season gets underway threatens to derail another summer.
In France, the world’s most visited country, visitors to cultural and tourist sites were confronted this week with a new requirement for a special Covid pass.
To get the pass, which comes in paper or digital form, people must prove they’re either fully vaccinated or recently recovered from an infection, or produce a negative virus test. Use of the pass could extend next month to restaurants and cafes.
Italy said Thursday that people will need a similar pass to access museums and movie theatres, dine inside restaurants and cafes, and get into pools, casinos and a range of other venues.
At the Eiffel Tower, unprepared tourists lined up for quick virus tests so they could get the pass to visit the Paris landmark. Johnny Nielsen, visiting from Denmark with his wife and two children, questioned the usefulness of the French rules.
If I get tested now, I can go but then I (could) get corona in the queue right here, Nielsen said, though he added they wouldn’t change their plans because of it.
Juan Truque, a tourist from Miami, said he wasn’t vaccinated but took a test so he could travel to France via Spain with his mother. Now they are forcing you to wear masks and to do similar kind of things that are impositions to you. To me, they are violations to your freedom. he said.
Europe’s vital travel and tourism industry is desperate to make up after a disastrous 2020. International tourist arrivals to Europe last year plunged by nearly 70%, and for the first five months of this year, they’re down 85 per cent, according to UN World Tourism Organisation figures.
American, Japanese and Chinese travellers aren’t confident it will be possible to visit and move freely within Europe, the European Travel Commission said. International arrivals are forecast to remain at nearly half their 2019 level this year, though domestic demand will help make up the shortfall.
The UK’s statistics office suspended its monthly international passenger data, because it said there aren’t enough people arriving to provide robust estimates.
The United States this week upgraded its travel warning for Britain to the highest level. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advised Americans to avoid travelling to the country because of the risk of contracting Covid-19 variants, while the US State Department raised its alert level to do not travel from the previous less severe reconsider travel advisory.
The recommendations are constantly under review and not binding, although they may affect group tours and insurance rates. Britain’s warning has fluctuated several times this year already.
Some countries are showing signs of a rebound, however. Spain, the world’s second-most visited country, received 3.2 million tourists from January to May a tenth of the amount in the same period of 2019. But visits surged in June with 2.3 million arrivals, the best monthly figure since the start of the pandemic, although still only 75 per cent of the figure from two years ago.
Spain’s secretary of state for tourism, Fernando Valdes, credited the European Union’s deployment in June of its digital Covid-19 vaccine passport for having a a positive impact on foreign arrivals. That, and the UK move to allow nonessential travel, allowed us to start the 2021 summer season in the best conditions, he said.
The EU app allows the bloc’s residents to show they’ve been vaccinated, tested negative or recovered from the virus.
In Greece, where Covid-19 infections are also rising sharply, authorities have openly expressed concern that slowing vaccination rates could hurt the struggling tourism industry, a mainstay of the economy. Authorities have tightened restrictions for unvaccinated tourists and residents, banning their entry to all indoor dining and entertainment venues.
Development Minister Adonis Georgiadis urged the travel industry to put on a brave face. It’s very important that we do not give the impression that we have lost control of the pandemic, Georgiadis said last week.
Some countries sparked chaos with last-minute changes to entry rules. Denmark’s decision to upgrade Britain to its red list of countries with tighter travel restrictions threw London resident Richard Moorby’s vacation plans into disarray.
Moorby originally planned to go to Copenhagen in August to meet up with his Danish wife and their two children visiting his in-laws like they did last summer. But under current rules Moorby wouldn’t have been able to travel separately because he’s not Danish.
They planned instead to travel together, which they thought would be allowed even after the change but they missed the announcement’s fine print prohibiting non-Danes from red list countries including the UK from visiting without a worthy purpose, which doesn’t include tourism.
It was going to be a bit of a non-holiday anyway, Moorby said. But it went from, We’d have a nice holiday in Denmark,’ to well, maybe I can just about get there,’ to I can’t even travel’.
Meanwhile, the UK government unexpectedly announced that travellers coming from France would still have to self-isolate for up 10 days because of worries about the beta variant, frustrating travelers and angering the tourism industry and French government.
Emma and Ben Heywood, the British owners of adventure travel company Undiscovered Montenegro, said booking inquiries are surging after the UK government said in the same announcement it would stop advising against travel to countries on its amber list and dropped the self-isolation rule for returning travelers.
The couple said bookings last summer plunged to 10 per cent of their usual level but now they’re at 30 per cent and rising fast. Montenegro has a relatively low infection rate and relaxed entry requirements.
It’s so hard keeping everybody up to date with what’s required to go where, with so many countries and so many different rules involved, said Ben Heywood. It’s a total minefield. Half the emails I’m fielding now are people saying, We definitely want to come.

As the restrictions on shooting have been lifted again, the team of Chehre is getting back on the sets to make sure that the audience gets their dose of entertainment with this film very soon.

"US COVID-19 cases rising again, doubling over three weeks",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/15/us-covid-19-cases-rising-again-doubling-over-three-weeks/,"July 15, 2021",Agency,Entertainment,"Washington: The COVID-19 curve in the US is rising again after months of decline, with the number of new cases per day doubling over the past three weeks, driven by the fast-spreading delta variant, lagging vaccination rates and Fourth of July gatherings.
Confirmed infections climbed to an average of about 23,600 a day on Monday, up from 11,300 on June 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data. And all but two states — Maine and South Dakota — reported that case numbers have gone up over the past two weeks.
It is certainly no coincidence that we are looking at exactly the time that we would expect cases to be occurring after the July Fourth weekend, said Dr Bill Powderly, co-director of the infectious-disease division at Washington University’s School of Medicine in St Louis.
At the same time, parts of the country are running up against deep vaccine resistance, while the highly contagious mutant version of the coronavirus that was first detected in India is accounting for an ever-larger share of infections.
Nationally, 55.6 per cent of all Americans have received at least one COVID-19 shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The five states with the biggest two-week jump in cases per capita all had lower vaccination rates: Missouri, 45.9 per cent; Arkansas, 43 per cent; Nevada, 50.9 per cent; Louisiana, 39.2 per cent; and Utah, 49.5 per cent.
Even with the latest surge, cases in the US are nowhere near their peak of a quarter-million per day in January. And deaths are running at under 260 per day on average after topping out at more than 3,400 over the winter — a testament to how effectively the vaccine can prevent serious illness and death in those who happen to become infected.
Still, amid the rise, health authorities in places such as Los Angeles County and St. Louis are begging even immunized people to resume wearing masks in public. And Chicago officials announced Tuesday that unvaccinated travelers from Missouri and Arkansas must either quarantine for 10 days or have a negative COVID-19 test.
Meanwhile, the Health Department in Mississippi, which ranks dead last nationally for vaccinations, began blocking posts about COVID-19 on its Facebook page because of a rise of misinformation about the virus and the vaccine.
Mississippi officials are also recommending that people 65 and older and those with chronic underlying conditions stay away from large indoor gatherings because of a 150 per cent rise in hospitalizations over the past three weeks.
In Louisiana, which also has one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates, officials in the city of New Orleans said Tuesday that they are likely to extend until fall virus-mitigation efforts currently in place at large sporting and entertainment gatherings, including mask mandates or requirements that attendees be vaccinated or have a negative COVID-19 test. State health officials said cases of the coronavirus are surging, largely among nonvaccinated people.
But the political will may not be there in many states fatigued by months of restrictions.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov Gretchen Whitmer is facing a drive to repeal a law that she used to set major restrictions during the early stages of the pandemic.
And Republican Gov Kay Ivey of Alabama pushed back against the idea that the state might need to reimpose preventive measures as vaccinations lag and hospitalizations rise.
Alabama is OPEN for business. Vaccines are readily available, and I encourage folks to get one. The state of emergency and health orders have expired. We are moving forward, she said on social media.
Dr James Lawler, a leader of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, said bringing back masks and limiting gatherings would help. But he acknowledged that most of the places seeing higher rates of the virus are exactly the areas of the country that don’t want to do any of these things. Lawler warned that what is happening in Britain is a preview of what’s to come in the US.
The descriptions from regions of the world where the delta variant has taken hold and become the predominant virus are pictures of ICUs full of 30-year-olds. That’s what the critical care doctors describe and that’s what’s coming to the US, he said."

I trust the vaccines made in India: Vidya Balan,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/05/i-trust-the-vaccines-made-in-india-vidya-balan/,"July 5, 2021",Agency,Entertainment,"Bollywood actor Vidya Balan, who is currently being lauded for her role in Amit Masurkar’s ‘Sherni’ acknowledges that the coronavirus pandemic put a tremendous amount of pressure and stress on our healthcare workers.
Despite this, they continue to work tirelessly, giving us the best of care — a reality we don’t see often unless we visit a hospital or a healthcare facility, Vidya said.
The popular actor has joined hands with Vicks to lend her voice in support of all doctors and healthcare workers in the country. The brand, through its #TouchOfCare campaign, recently launched a heart-warming film on the inspiring journey of late Dnyaneshwar Bhosale’s selfless acts of care.
Bhosale left no stone unturned to ensure that many less fortunate children received life-saving medical attention during the pandemic. A doctor who lost his life to Covid-19, Bhosale left behind his wife, kids, and his dreams of building his own paediatric hospital. The film pays tribute to Bhosale and hundreds of doctors like him who lost their lives during the pandemic while extending their ‘Touch Of Care’ to the many souls in need.
Vidya said that she wished to bring to light the invisible force behind the doctors themselves: their families.
Vidya shared: I salute Bhosale’s wife and family for supporting his selfless work! He showed us how a simple act of care can change the lives of those who need it. With his unrelenting spirit, Bhosale worked day and night during the pandemic, and like many other doctors and healthcare workers, left us too soon. I wish Mrs. Bhosale all the strength in the world to make Mr Bhosale’s dream a reality and keep his care alive among the little children of Latur.
The National Film Award winning actor has acted in many female-led films, paving the path for change in not just the entertainment but also related industries with her bold voice. She supports the well-being message of staying at home and staying safe.
Vidya advocates for Indians to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus so that we can all do our bit to reduce the burden on our healthcare systems and workers.
To support the selfless, unflinching, and challenging work by doctors and healthcare workers during this pandemic, Vidya said, I trust the vaccines made in India, and urge everyone to maintain social distance and wash their hands regularly. I hope our country gets vaccinated soon and we are able to fight this virus with zeal!"

Julia Butters to star in Spielberg’s autobiographical film,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/06/17/julia-butters-to-star-in-spielbergs-autobiographical-film/,"June 17, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Julia Butters, the young actor who stole scenes outright from Leonardo DiCaprio in ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’, will soon be playing a character inspired by Steven Spielberg’s sister in the filmmaker’s untitled semi-autobiographical film about his childhood.
According to Variety, she’ll be joining Michelle Williams, Paul Dano and Seth Rogen, who are playing characters loosely based on Spielberg’s mother, father, and favorite uncle, respectively, and newcomer Gabriel LaBelle, who is playing the character based on a young Spielberg.
For the first time since 2001’s ‘A.I.: Artificial Intelligence’, Spielberg has been credited as a co-writer of the screenplay, along with regular collaborator Tony Kushner. Spielberg and Kushner are also producing the film with Kristie Macosko Krieger, through Amblin Partners. Production is set to start in the summer, with a release in 2022, most likely through Amblin’s existing distribution deal with Universal.
The film will be drawing from Spielberg’s experiences when his family lived in Arizona in the late 1950s and ’60s, which coincided with his earliest experiments with making home movies. Spielberg has three younger sisters, the oldest of which, Anne, followed her brother into feature filmmaking, working at his production company Amblin Entertainment, before co-writing the 1988 comedy ‘Big’ with Gary Ross. Butters’ character, however, is her own creation, not based on a specific sibling.
After walking away with every scene, she had in Quentin Tarantino’s 2019 love letter to old Hollywood, Butters became an overnight star. As per Variety, now 12 years old, she’s currently shooting the Russo brothers’ thriller ‘The Gray Man’ with Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans."

Sherni my salute to women who are invisibilised: Vidya Balan,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/06/16/sherni-my-salute-to-women-who-are-invisibilised-vidya-balan/,"June 16, 2021",Agency,Entertainment,"Actor Vidya Balan on Tuesday said her latest drama ‘Sherni’ is an ode to countless women who navigate their way and overcome several challenges, sometimes even without making any noise.
In Amit Masurkar’s drama, Balan plays an upright forest officer who is tasked to resolve the man-animal conflict.
Through her journey, the film follows how Balan’s character, Vidya, takes on the patriarchal society and navigates her way through social barriers put up for women.
During a virtual press conference, the actor said the film is a representation of women of all kinds, who are striving to make a change.
You don’t need to roar to be a tigress. There are various shades, reflections of ‘sherni’ (tigress) that each of us represents. My character is a woman of few words, reserved but strong-willed. So you can be that.
You don’t have to scream out loud from the rooftops to be heard all the time or even be visible all the time. In each of the households in India, there’s a ‘sherni’, and a lot of times she’s invisible. This is my salute to all of them out there, Balan told reporters.
Produced by T-Series and Abundantia Entertainment, Sherni is set to stream on Amazon Prime Video on June 18.
The 42-year-old actor said because she’s a public figure, the audience is able to see and appreciate the tigress in her, but the will to survive and fight back is inherent to all.
I believe every woman is a sherni. She is navigating her way through this thick jungle called life. We are constantly facing challenges. I love that line in our song which says, museebat ko aisa panja maregi. I know that at every step of the way, women today are doing that (overcoming difficulties) The reason we are able to do that is because the women before us did that.
Sherni is the latest Balan film to put a woman in the forefront and follow her struggle, after a series of movies like Shakuntala Devi (2020), Mission Mangal (2019), and 2017 drama Tumhari Sulu.
The actor said she isn’t consciously choosing to attempt films that are inspiring.
If they happen to inspire along the way, that’s a bonus. I pick up stories that I find compelling, irresistible. That’s also true for the characters I choose. If we are getting to tell great female-centric stories, then why not. I am the hero of the piece and I love that.
Because I am the centre of my universe and if I am getting to be the centre of the film also, then (good), she added Sherni also stars Sharad Saxena, Mukul Chaddha, Vijay Raaz, Ila Arun, Brijendra Kala and Neeraj Kabi."
‘Restore imposition of 10% TDS to films to last year levels’,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/06/16/restore-imposition-of-10-tds-to-films-to-last-year-levels/,"June 16, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Film producers in Tamil Nadu have appealed to the Finance Ministry to reduce the Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) for films, stating that over 120 films with investments of over Rs 1,000 crore were stuck in Tamil film industry alone and unable to be released in theatres due to the COVID-19 induced lockdown.
According to the Tamil Film Active Producers’ Association, the imposition of 10 per cent TDS on distribution of cinematographic films, has come a ‘big shock’ and would impact lakhs of people associated with the film industry.
In a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, CII Media and Entertainment (South) T G Thyagarajan said when Indian film industry was facing a decline by close to 60 per cent, it requires the Ministry’s support to revive post the pandemic.
Any drastic change in the tax rates like TDS at 10 per cent shall lead to closure of the film industry..which will impact lakhs of people associated with the industry, Thyagarajan, also the treasurer of Tamil Film Active Producers Association, said.
Noting that the TDS on royalties related to cinematographic films till March 2020 was at two per cent and was later reduced to 1.5 per cent during the pandemic, he said, the sudden imposition of 10 per cent TDS for FY 2021-22 will become a big burden to the producers who are already under heavy losses.” The industry slowly started reviving from January 2021 and before it could begin running on its feet, the second lockdown imposed by various state governments severely impacted the film industry, he said.
Today hundreds of films are stuck, unable to be released in theatres and recover their investment, he said.
He pointed out that a study conducted by trade body Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and consultancy firm Ernst and Young, released in March 2021, said the ‘film entertainment segment’ declined by 40 per cent to Rs 7,200 crore in 2020 from Rs 11,900 crore in 2019.
With the ongoing outbreak, it (turnover) may further decline by another 25 per cent and touch a level of around Rs 5,000 crore turnover, meaning the industry declined by 60 per cent in the last two years, he said.
On behalf of TFAPA, we appeal to you to reconsider the decision to impose 10 per cent TDS on royalties relating to Cinematographic films and restore at the same level of two per cent until the film industry revives, he said in the letter."

Proud to be an independent woman: Huma Qureshi,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/05/27/proud-to-be-an-independent-woman-huma-qureshi/,"May 27, 2021",Agency,Entertainment,"Huma Qureshi says she is proud of the woman she has become after overcoming many personal challenges in her pursuit to become an actor.
The Delhi-born actor is the daughter of Saleem Qureshi, the owner of the national capital’s one of the most successful restaurants Saleem’s, and homemaker mother Ameena Qureshi.
Qureshi, who initially performed in a few theatre productions in Delhi before heading to Mumbai, said she had to overcome many things when she decided to leave home in 2008.
‘I had to overcome a lot of things like everybody, like my own fear of success, the fact that I came from a new city, had to learn how to make friends, how to pay my taxes, run a household, run my career and nobody was there to teach me,” the 34-year-old actor, who made her debut with 2012’s ”Gangs of Wasseypur’ films, told PTI in an interview.
‘Today, it has made me the woman I am today. I am very proud that I have come from nowhere. I am an independent woman, I run my own life. I have made my own identity and that gives me a lot of joy and pride. It makes my parents proud,’ she added.
The actor plays a docile village woman who is handpicked to become the chief minister of Bihar in her upcoming web series ‘Maharani’
Calling her character of Rani Bharti in the Bihar-set series the ‘role of a lifetime’, Qureshi said writers and creators must come up with more well-rounded parts for female protagonists.
‘It doesn’t have to always be about the woman, but there should be more fleshed out female protagonists. That is very important. Hence a role like Rani Bharti in ‘Maharani’ is exciting to do.’ The series, slated to start streaming on SonyLIV from Friday, is created by Subhash Kapoor, who previously directed the actor in ‘Jolly LLB’. Karan Sharma is the director.
The story explores themes of patriarchy, something that women have to face everyday and in every field, the actor said. ‘Patriarchy is something that women have to deal with irrespective, it is there in the world, it has nothing to do with entertainment or politics or business.’ Qureshi said she gravitates towards complex characters’ and she found one in Rani.
‘She is a village woman, uneducated, illiterate, never travelled outside her village so she has all these things going against her. But she is also a little aspirational because she wants to take you on this journey like ‘what would you do if you were a chief minister for a day? ‘Maharani’ is rumoured to be inspired by Rabri Devi, the wife of former Bihar CM Lalu Prasad Yadav, who had assumed the chief ministership after he quit following an uproar over fodder scam in the 1990s.
But Qureshi maintained that the show is a work of fiction. ‘LIt is not inspired by any real life politician or anything. It is completely fiction. Just because it is Bihar, people have made assumptions. Our show is completely a work of fiction and so there were no references to look at,’ she said.
”Maharani” is Qureshi’s second project that releases this month after she starred in Hollywood filmmaker Zack Snyder’s Netflix movie ”Army of the Dead”.
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the actor said she has taught herself to be ”less critical” of her work.
‘All of us are trying to do our best, all of us are struggling a lot. In fact, I was harsher on myself a few years ago. I was in a different mindset but now because of the pandemic, I’m in a different mindset.
‘Let’s be kinder. Not just to other people but to your own self as well. You have achieved a lot and you don’t have to compare yourself to other people. You are doing your best and trusting yourself,’ Qureshi said.
Besides her work commitments, the actor also started a fundraiser with Snyder to raise money for building a temporary hospital facility in Delhi with an oxygen plant for COVID-19 patients.
Qureshi said the work has started on constructing the facility and she is grateful to all the people who helped them raise the funds.
‘We selected a place in Tilak Nagar and about 70 oxygen concentrators have already reached over there. So the work has started. The government is helping us. A lot of organisations and so many individuals have extended support.
‘The generosity and kindness has humbled me. This pandemic has shown us the worst side of people but it has also shown the best side of human beings and how generous and kind they can be.’ The actor believes social media is often labelled as toxic but it was really helpful during the devastating second wave of the pandemic in the country.
‘We abuse social media a lot but the fact is it can be used in a positive change and so many lives have been saved. It is all because citizens have connected and helped each other. The goodness in people motivates me’. Maharani also stars Amit Sial, Sohum Shah and Vineet Kumar."

Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra which is home to Hindi film industry, on Monday recorded a steep drop in new coronavirus cases at 1,794, the lowest single-day count in nearly two months, while 74 patients succumbed to the infection, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) updated data.
The state’s overall caseload now stands at 51,38,973 while 549 fatalities pushed the toll 76,398, the health department said.
Salman Khan, however, said he was ”disappointed” for the theatre owners and the fans who like to watch his films on the big screen.
‘I’m very disappointed for that because I wish this film would have been seen in the theatres on Eid but it is not possible because of the current situation,’ the ”Bharat” star said.
Radhe’ harks back to the character of Salman Khan’s protagonist of the same name from his 2009 blockbuster ‘Wanted’, also directed by Prabhudheva. The whistle-worthy one-liner of the hit action movie ‘Ek baar jo maine commitment kar di, uske baad toh main apne aap ki bhi nahin sunta (Once I commit, then I don’t even listen to myself.) also makes a stylish comeback.
But the actor emphasised ‘Radhe’ was not the sequel and only has the ‘vibe’ similar to ‘Wanted’.
‘It’s not a sequel to ‘Wanted’, it’s just that the character’s name is Radhe. Radhe was also in ‘Tere Naam’. Prem (another one of his popular on-screen names) was also in a lot of films. The character (Radhe) has that vibe to it, that ‘commitment’ dialogue, reminiscing something for the fans. But this is a different film altogether,’ he added.
If the audience liked ‘Radhe’, ‘we will bring out its sequel’, Salman Khan promised.
Last week, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Salman Khan Films, the actor’s production banner, pledged to provide support towards COVID-19 relief work across the country through the revenue generated from the upcoming film.
Calling the decision ‘a very selfish’ one, Salman Khan said whatever they are doing, ‘it will never be enough’.
‘What if I need it someday? What if I need somebody like me to help me out at that time? So, it’s not selflessness. I think we should all be like that. God forbid, when we ourselves are in trouble, there should be someone like you to help you out.’ The actor, who got his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in March, also shared that he will get his second jab ‘in the next 10 days’.
‘Mum and dad took their second vaccination (shot) yesterday,’ he said of his parents veteran screenwriter Salim Khan and producer Salma Khan, adding that brother-producer Arbaaz Khan took his first shot on Sunday.
Salman Khan also mentioned that his sister Arpita Khan Sharma had COVID-19 ‘long back’.
Later, in an Instagram post, Arpita said she tested positive for the virus in the beginning of April and was ‘asymptomatic’.
‘I followed all the guidelines and protocols and thankfully with the grace of God I have fully recovered and have been well since. Stay safe, stay strong, stay positive,” she added.
The superstar further urged people to get tested once they have symptoms and start the treatment immediately.
‘That’s the only way to survive this,’ he added.
‘Radhe”l features Salman Khan as an encounter specialist tackling drug menace in Mumbai.
Produced by Salma Khan, Sohail Khan and Reel Life Production Private Limited, the film also stars Gautam Gulati."
"Salman to provide financial aid to 25,000 cine workers",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/05/08/salman-to-provide-financial-aid-to-25000-cine-workers/,"May 8, 2021",NT Bureau,Entertainment,"Chennai: Salman Khan has come forward and pledged to offer monetary help to 25,000 daily wage earners of the film industry, the Federation of Western Indian Cine Employees (FWICE) said on Friday.
According to B N Tiwari, FWICE of President, the 55-year-old actor will be paying Rs 1,500 to every worker on monthly basis.
We got a confirmation from Salman Khan last night that he will help 25,000 workers with Rs 1,500 each monthly. We will soon finalise and send the list of the workers to those who are in dire need,’ Tiwari told PTI.
In order to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the Maharashtra government has suspended shoot of all films and shows in the state.
Following this, makers of several film and TV shoots from Mumbai recently shifted their shooting base to Goa.
However, the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) on Thursday cancelled all permissions granted for shootings in the state in the wake of the surge of COVID-19 cases.
FWICE has a total of 2.5 lakh workers including junior artists, make-up artistes, stuntmen, spotboys and technicians.
Most recently, Khan’s banner Salman Khan Films announced that the revenue earned from the superstar’s upcoming film ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ will be utilised to support COVID-19 relief work across the country.
The actor also financially supported daily wage earners in 2020 when the country witnessed nationwide lockdown in the wake of the pandemic.
Last year, Netflix had announced that it will contribute Rs 7.5 crore to Producers Guild of India (PGI) Relief Fund to help daily wage earners.
Tiwari revealed that the two organisations will transfer Rs 3.5 crore from the sum to 7,000 wage workers.
“We are informed that Netflix and Producers Guild of India will help 7,000 cine workers with Rs 5,000 each. A total of Rs 3.5 crore help. We have sent them the list of the workers,” Tiwari said.
The FWICE president lamented the callous behaviour of the state and central governments, saying that there has been no help from them for the daily wage earners. “There is no help from the state or central government so far for the workers and this is really disheartening,” he said.

According to the CAIT, the situation has led business of various verticals of goods to go down by an average of 45 per cent in the last 10 days.
The Confederation also urged the Central government and the chief ministers to take all possible steps to prevent further Covid spread.
Besides, it cited the double whammy of lower intra-regional trade due to the restrictions and subdued local buyers’ sentiments.
The main reason for this decline is the panic among the people due to the third wave of Corona, the CAIT said.
Reluctant mood of traders to come to the distribution centres from neighbouring cities, money crunch, large sums of money getting stuck in credit and imposition of various Covid restrictions without consulting the traders are some of the factors that have hit the businesses, it said.
 The CAIT also expects a major business decline during the wedding season.
 During the wedding season, which will start on the day of Makar Sankranti on January 14 and go on for two-and-a-half months, business of about Rs 4 lakh crore was expected, it said.
But due to the various restrictions imposed by the state governments across the country, a steep drop is seen in the business of nearly about 75 per cent, it added.
Now it is estimated that in the next two-and-a-half months, there is a possibility of about Rs 1.25 lakh crore only in this business vertical, it added."

RSWM to foray into knitted fabric business,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/06/rswm-to-foray-into-knitted-fabric-business/,"December 6, 2021",NT Bureau,Business,"New Delhi: RSWM Ltd, a group company of the LNJ Bhilwara, is foraying into knitted fabric in line with the demand trend which will contribute Rs 800 crore to its topline over the next two to three years, a senior company official said on Sunday.
One of the largest makers and exporters of synthetic and blended spun yarns from India, RSWM Ltd was also exploring opportunity into garmenting fabrication franchising as international brands are now keen on finished garments rather than buying yarns.
The Rs 3,000 crore company has earmarked Rs 200 crore for the foray and is implementing the first phase of the 400 tonne capacity project. The company hived off woven fabric brand Mayur and was in process of using the same land and building to install the knitted fabric plant at a cost of Rs 80 crore in the phase I.
‘Demand for woven fabric has dwindled while there is a surge in knitted fabric from both domestic and international brands. We have earmarked Rs 200 crore for the segment and are currently investing Rs 80 crore in plant and machinery in our existing facility,’ RSWM Joint MD Brij Mohan Sharma said.
‘The knitted fabric plant will become operational in April 2022 and will add to Rs 275 crore to our topline in a year with 400 tonne plant capacity but sales will scale up to Rs 800 crore after the capacity gets augmented to 1000 tonne,’ he said.
While, the total capex for the current fiscal will be around Rs 250 crore and over next 2-3 years investments will be another Rs 500 crore in new, upgradation and debottlenecking projects spread over various plants, he said.
Sharma said they are strongly exploring getting into garmenting but not directly.
‘We supply yarn to all leading global brands, but now they are demanding finished garments. We are interested but through fabricators or franchisees as the garmenting business thrived only under small scale. We will offer soft bridge loans to set up or expand with buyback arrangements,’ Sharma said.
Speaking about outlook, the company said amid uncertainties the growth and demand momentum will stay at least for next two years.
Amid Covid pandemic, the company reported Rs 44.75 crore in the quarter ended September 2021 as against net loss of Rs 15 crore during the previous quarter ended September 2020 and was aiming for one of the best performance in a decade."

A growing economy is supported by business activity and innovations. But everything that grows reaches a saturation point, beyond which the same efforts do not give the same results.
Hence, the economy starts slowing down after a phase of growth and expansion. In the phase of slowdown and recession, business activity drops. But as businesses start cutting down on expenses and figuring out more cost-effective ways to expand, the economy starts growing again. This is the ongoing business/economic cycle.
Each phase in the business cycle presents unique investment opportunities. So, incorporating business cycles themes into investments helps make the most of the current economic environment.

We have no option as a society, as a business but to really adopt a sustainable business model,’ he said speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum.  And embracing a model of clean energy is a pre-requisite.
Every unit making up the oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance would have to pivot as the conglomerate moves toward net-zero, he said.
“We at Reliance have adopted this wholeheartedly and transforming each one of our business lines to be sustainable, circular, recyclable and fully transparent environment, social, and governance standards,” he said.

While some small and medium businesses (SMBs) have seen a gradual improvement, the pace of economic recovery has slowed significantly in recent months.
Recent increases in disease spread in some countries are likely to reinforce an underlying sense of fragility and the importance of ongoing financial support for SMBs, according to Facebook’s sixth Global State of Small Business Report.
It shows that business conditions have improved since the first survey, but not everywhere, and not for all small businesses, said Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer.
According to the report, the closure rates for small businesses fell to 15 per cent in October, down 11 percentage points from May (26 per cent).
Nearly 55 per cent of those that remain open reported lower sales in October compared to the same month in 2019. However, the proportion of businesses reporting a drop of more that 50 per cent in year-on-year sales in increasing.
Despite a gradual improvement in the sales environment, more than 1 in 4 SMBs continued to report difficulty in paying rent or leases, and moire that a third said they had cut jobs in response to the pandemic, mentioned the report.
Still, business owners and managers are resilient. The survey shows that despite everything, more than half remain optimistic about the future of their business, Sandberg said in a blog post on Monday.
Many have acted creatively to find new ways to reach customers, with more than one in four reporting that they have increased or greatly increased their proportion of sales they have made digitally during the course of the pandemic.

Ola keen to build electric two-wheeler business,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/11/28/ola-keen-to-build-electric-two-wheeler-business/,"November 28, 2020",NT Bureau,Business,"New Delhi: Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal on Friday said the company is focused on aggressively building a global electric two-wheeler business, and will also play across different vehicle segments over the next few years.
The co-founder of the ride-hailing major also noted that India – with its unique skill sets and manpower – can be a bridge for developing paradigms and technologies for both developed and developing nations.
Speaking at a CII event, Aggarwal said there are four broad segments of vehicles, including large commercial vehicles (buses and trucks), western-style four-wheelers, Asian and European style four-wheelers (small city cars), and two and three-wheelers.
Our ambition is to be the leader in electric mobility for the small vehicles and small city four-wheelers. And unlike Tesla or many of the American companies, which are building for their own audiences, we have to build for our audiences. India is the world’s largest two-wheeler market. Asia is 80-90 per cent of the global two-wheeler market, he explained.
Aggarwal pointed out that two-wheelers on an aggregate basis create more pollution today than four-wheelers in some geographies, and to solve this, the company is focused on aggressively building a global (electric) two-wheeler business.
According to sources, Ola is planning to foray into electric scooter manufacturing and plans to hit the market with its first vehicle in January next year.
The electric scooter, initially manufactured at a facility in the Netherlands, will be sold in India as well as Europe. Ola, however, has not commented on the exact timeline for the launch of e-scooter.

Business sentiments recover: CII Survey,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/09/21/business-sentiments-recover-cii-survey/,"September 21, 2020",NT Bureau,Business,"Mumbai: With the gradual lifting of the restrictions on economic activities across the country, business sentiments have recovered with the CII Business Confidence Index surging to 50.3 in the July-September period.
During the April-June quarter of 2020, it recorded its lowest reading at 41.0. The stellar recovery in the index has been supported by the remarkable increase in the Expectations Index (EI), which rose 46 per cent quarter-on-quarter, to the level of 55.2, as the nationwide lockdown restrictions were lifted, and businesses gradually began to reopen during the July-September quarter, a CII statement said.
The ‘Current Situation Index’, on the other hand, was recorded below the psychological level of 50 — at 40.6 — as the stringent lockdown restrictions led to the complete shutdown of most business operations for a larger part of the quarter, thus impacting business sentiments.
Commenting on the survey results, Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, said: It is heartening to note the recovery in CII’s Business Confidence Index for the July-September quarter, indicating an improvement in business conditions during the period. However, while a recovery is underway, it could be tremendously expedited through continued government support and hand-holding of businesses during this crisis.
Although business sentiments have strengthened, the demand scenario continues to remain weak, as per the survey.
More than half of the respondents (51 per cent) have indicated that the weakness in domestic demand is likely to be the top-most risk to business confidence in the next six months, it said.
Further, nearly 30 per cent of the respondents feel that the business activity may return to the pre-pandemic levels by Q1 FY22.

According to BenQ India Managing Director Rajeev Singh, the company’s institutional sales for flat screen wall and projectors have suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but its impact has been compensated with increase in sales of monitor and projectors by retail customers.
In terms of percentage, we are definitely looking at a 15 to 20 per cent increase. We are expecting at least three times growth in our monitor business during this year as compared to last year, and we work on a calendar year basis, Singh said.
He said because of work from home, learning and entertainment at home, the demand for company’s business to consumer (B2C) products has increased, specifically for monitors.
Before COVID-19, two-thirds of BenQ’s business came from sales of projectors and interactive flat panels and one-third of business was being contributed by monitors. Now the situation post-COVID has reversed. Now two-thirds of our total business is from monitors and one-third is from projectors and interactive flat panels because there’s a shift from mainly B2B to B2C. We are seeing a net impact that is going to be positive, Singh said.
According to IDC, the company recorded 163 per cent year-on-year surge in sales of monitors during April-June quarter in 2020. Singh said most of the sales for the company are now coming from e-commerce platforms and it is ramping up manpower to handle digital sales.
I think going forward, things will improve, but a major part of the buying has happened from e-commerce platforms. We have been very active in promoting our products from Amazon. “Right now, we are planning in a big way for the Diwali sales, and to support this, we are making continuous investments to ramp up our capability in the e-commerce part of the business as well as for digital marketing,” he said.
The company had freezed hiring March 1 onwards, but revoked it on 1 September. “We are again looking at expanding our teams. In terms of a percentage, I can tell you, we plan to add close to a 15 per cent additional manpower in the next six months,” Singh said.

Explained: How businesses will be affected post pandemic,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/05/20/explained-how-businesses-will-be-affected-post-pandemic/,"May 20, 2020",Naomi N,Business,"Chennai: Hereafter people will be referring to time as “Before Corona” and “After Corona”, because the way of living may change drastically, especially in ways of spending.
The lull is said to be the most deeper among the recessions the nation has ever experienced. Statistics say that India’s growth is estimated to shrink from an earlier estimate of 0.4 per cent to -3.6 per cent.
The nation’s GDP is expected to fall by five per cent for the year 2020-21. So how will this affect business and the way in which people spend? Is the cash crunch real or artificially created?
News Today  looks at a few industries to understand the way how things have changed. S Kumararaja, a builder in the city, says he had turned down a new project a few days ago. With the exodus of migrant labourers from the city. he says the real estate is badly affected by the shutdown.
He says that clients of a newly completed apartment complex have cancelled the booking as they are unable to pay the EMI to the banks and are asking for reimbursements.
It would take two years for the industry to stabilise, he says, “The prices of building materials like cement, steel and sand have increased. People may not be interested in buying apartments on the city outskirts like before. Manpower is yet another problem. I sent labourers to Kolkatta and Odisha. I spoke to 27 of them and only four said they would return.”
Kumararaja says he is leaving the business and is contemplating farming in his plot on ECR. Experts say that agriculture, pharma companies and hospitals are the three sectors which are going to make profit. There is already an increased demand for herbal medicines in the market.
Travel and tourism will experience a low too. Hotel industries, tour operators, resorts had to deal with cancellations in the last two months.
Even as it is said that the hospitals and health sectors will be gaining, Dr Ravindranath of Doctors Association for Social Equality says that it is the corporate hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and businesses involved in making medical devices which will make profit.
Even during the lockdown, the small clinics, laboratories, and nursing homes were unable to run due to lack of manpower.
They did not have sufficient PPE kits and using them would escalate the fees. Hospitals cannot keep imposing the charges for PPE kits on patients, he explained.
The field of marketing, advertising and public relations (PR) is facing unprecedented times. An independent PR professional said, “There are no big events happening and clients are not advertising. Those who are working in PR firms have taken a pay cut and many co-working spaces have closed. They have been asked to work from home even after the lockdown is lifted. Some have lost jobs and the future of PR looks bleak. Clients are talking about pay cuts and are interested in webinars in future instead of going for a conference.”
PR professionals understand that they will not be able to host events in the near future due to social distancing norms which are here to stay for few more months. They expect a year’s time for the business to pick up and are waiting for brands to re-start business.
Subashini Ganapathy of Subashini and Associates has a different perspective to offer. “Nature of spending will be seen in two ways. One section who are tuned to this way of living will continue this way. And nothing will change in the ways of those who are addicted to spending,” she says.
Multinational companies have sufficient accumulated reserves and can survive without profits for at least two years with just overhead costs. But there are entities who do not want to spend the reserves and exhaust them and stand with empty hands, creating a situation that no one has money: an artificial crunch.
The real sufferers, she said are the small and medium-sized enterprises who had lean profits. Even malls and theatres will not run out of business as 60 per cent of those who visit these places are children and teens, who will still continue going out.
The major challenges for businesses however are going to be the stock lying untouched for months and manpower.

Business optimism falls to record low,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/04/21/business-optimism-falls-to-record-low/,"April 21, 2020",NT Bureau,Business,"New Delhi: Business optimism for the ongoing April-June quarter has slumped to its record low level, reflecting the plunge in business sentiment owing to the heightened uncertainty around the impact of Covid-19, according to a report.
The Dun & Bradstreet Composite Business Optimism Index stood at 49.40 per cent for Q2 2020 (April-June), a record low and worse than during the 2009 financial crisis. The index registered a decrease of 37 per cent as compared to the year-ago period.
The index has dropped 7 per cent more than it did during the 2009 financial crisis. The near halt in almost all non-essential activities in the industrial and services sectors due to the nation-wide lockdown has led to a fall in the optimism levels for net sales and new orders to the lowest level in 18 years, Dun & Bradstreet Chief Economist Arun Singh said.
The survey noted that the optimism for net profits stood at 48 per cent – a decrease of 21 percentage points as compared to same period last year, while optimism for new orders stood at 24 per cent – a decrease of 39 percentage points as compared to April-June 2019.
Singh further noted that the impact of Covid-19 started as a supply shock but has also triggered strong demand shocks and has led to the collapse of confidence levels.
The ripple effects of this are evident across the financial sector. The deceleration in demand is expected to cause severe crunch in cashflows, increase in corporate debt levels could even lead to large scale credit defaults and trigger bankruptcies, Singh said.
The report further said that all six optimism indices like — optimism for sales volumes, net profit, selling price, order book position, inventory and workforce size — have registered a decline on a year-on-year basis.
The Dun & Bradstreet Business Optimism Index is an indicator and is arrived at based on a quarterly survey of business expectations across companies from several sectors

Coronavirus ‘infects’ business in Ritchie Street,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-infects-business-in-ritchie-street/,"March 2, 2020",Samuel P,Business,"Chennai: In the wake of Coronavirus impacting global trades, India has steadily witnessed a convulsive effect in its markets as the economy is widely dependant on Chinese imports. According to World Bank, China is the world’s second largest economy accounting for around 16 per cent of the globe. As per the WTO (World Trade Organization), it ranks first in global merchandise exports and second in world merchandise imports. China’s merchandise export share in total world exports was 12.8 per cent in 2018 while its share in imports of merchandise goods was 10.8 per cent. But with the deadly disease spreading in this important market, it has left many traders across the world worried.
Worried traders
Here in Chennai, Ritchie Street has been the go-to place for electronic products. Coronavirus has blowed the business of shopkeepers here as the shortage of Chinese imports have left them face an unseen situation. ‘The electronics industry which primarily depends on Chinese products and components is severely affected. If no solution is found, both manufacturers depending on Chinese components and consumers will suffer,’ said the secretary of Chennai Electronic & Infotech Traders Association (CEITA), R Chandalia. ‘Now traders may be forced to import high cost products from other countries like Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan or other European countries at higher prices.’
Slash import duties
Experts talk about the urgent need to reduce tariff on foreign imports and tax on machinery and electronic goods. Chandalia says, ‘There is a shortfall of ‘goods from China like TV, laptops, mobiles, and electronic parts like capacitors, integrated circuits, cables which are used by manufacturing units in India.’ The effect is already visible as prices have started to increase across the market. ‘The government should remove higher import duties on certain products, primarily imported from China, but available in other countries,’ Chandalai added. ‘Electronics industry is the backbone of any developing country. We request the government to support by reducing import duty on primary products and reduce taxes and bring all products in the lowest slab to benefit consumers.’
Create effective policies
The lack of supply has left traders concerned. Business analysts predict that there could be a steep increase in the price of electronic goods to sustain themselves. According to analysts, the price of stock electronic goods may rise 20-40 per cent of the current price if import do not resume. Experts also speak about need for government in emerging Asian nations to create policies that ensures zero economic ripple effect due to the virus as many people’s livelihood depends on India and China’s trade relations."

Stock markets roared and crashed, trade wars were battled, new techs were introduced and jobs were lost or created. New businesses were born, new innovations tweaked the way we live.
With 2019 coming to an end, News Today compiles a list of sectors that made a huge dent. They were chosen based on impact they made to our lives. From online shopping to food delivery, from watching web series to e-learning, the 2010s has been a decade to remember.
* E-commerce
With birth of e-comm biz like Amazon, Flipkart, or Snapdeal, Indians changed the way they shop. The 2010s saw birth, collapse and mergers of top e-comm players. In May 2014, Myntra.com was acquired by Flipkart. Later, in 2016, Flipkart bought PhonePe and Jabong. Eventually, world retail giant Walmart bought Flipkart for $16 billion.
According to a report published in Statista, e-commerce is expected to boom in Asia. Current active e-commerce penetration in India stands only 28 percent with lots of room for improvement. India’s retail e-commerce compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is projected to reach 23 percent from 2016 to 2021, the report said.
“Close to 329.1 million people are projected to buy goods and services online in India by 2020. This means that about 70.7 percent of internet users in India will have purchased products online by then,” it said. Retail e-commerce sales in India are forecast to grow tremendously with projections to jump over $45 billion in 2021, Statista added.
* Transport

Commuting earned a whole new meaning when transportation network companies tapped into our lives with their ride-sharing apps. Ola and Uber were game changers. Soon, stories emerged of how drivers earned well. However, questions were raised regarding its safety, pricing and drivers’ credibility.
Statista reported that revenue in the Ride Hailing segment amounts to $30.36 billion in 2019. The revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate of 15.5 per cent, resulting in a market volume of $54.09 billion by 2023. ‘User penetration is expected to hit 20.3 per cent by 2023,’ the report said.
* Entertainment

With Amazon Prime, Hotstar, Netflix and others, Indians started consuming more digital content as subscription plans set a war among the platforms.
According to a report by global accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), India’s video streaming industry will grow at a CAGR of 21.82 per cent to reach Rs 11,977 crore by 2023. OTT will record the highest growth rate among all segments and drive evolution over next four years, it said.
* Food
Gone are the days when we had to step out to eat good food. Online food delivery businesses like Swiggy or Uber Eats gave Indians the ease to eat meals of their favourite restaurants right at home. Statista says, revenue in the online food delivery segment amounts to $7.7 billion in 2019. ‘Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2019-2024) of 11.3 per cent, resulting in a market volume of $13.2 billion by 2024,’ it said.
Online food delivery also paved way for groceries delivery business. According to an article published in Knowledge Wharton, grocery retail in India is estimated to be over 60 per cent of the country’s total retail market. “Analysts peg it anywhere between $400 billion to $600 billion at present with the potential to cross $700 billion by 2022,” the article said. “Online grocery is still small, but analysts see it as having huge potential. It is estimated to be around $500 million to a little over $1 billion currently and expected to cross $3 billion to $5 billion or even much more over the next three to four years.”
* Education
Online education has given students the freedom to learn without stepping into a classroom. Byju’s, Unacademy, Upgrad has witnessed steady growth. According to a research conducted by KPMG and Google, the online education industry will clock $1.96 billion by 2021. “Paid user base will grow 6X from 1.6 million users in 2016 to 9.6 million users in 2021,” the research ‘Online Education in India: 2021’ found."

Chennai: “Wealthy people should devote a substantial part of their wealth to public in the form of trusteeship. It was my mother and Mahatma Gandhi who strongly influenced my thinking. They taught me what to do with my privilege of wealth,” said Wipro chairman and philanthropist Azim Hashim Premji.
He was delivering the 19th Anantharamakrishnan Memorial Lecture and spoke on ‘Leading a young and digital India’ after being honored with the Madras Management Association-Amalgamations (MMA) Business Leadership Award 2019 on Thursday. The award was presented by Amalgamations Group chairman A Krishnamoorthy in the presence of top industry leaders.
The award was conferred upon him in recognition of his ability to build a business with impeccable integrity and uncompromising ethics, transforming Wipro into a global IT powerhouse, putting India on the world map as a software nation, being a true nation builder and making an outstanding contribution to business, industry and society.
“We have to trust the common people of our country,” Premji said. Citing an example, he added, “In my 20 years of work in education, teachers in the government schools who are often called callous are the most committed people. However, 80 per cent of them are devoted and 20 per cent among them are outstanding. It is these teachers who attend workshops even on Sundays by traveling on their own. It is not for money or promotion, but to do their job better.”
“Our success in business has taught us many things. But, in social issues, we have to start afresh. You have to be prepared for the processes of consensus, development of discovering large complexity and execution, and deeply conflicting but equally valid demands, very often not even knowing the next step forward. All of us have a duty to contribute to society,” said Premji. “The practice of moral leadership will help us achieve our goals. We need to work together to develop the India that we have envisioned in our Constitution, an idea that is equitable, humane and sustainable.”
Former chairman of ICICI Bank, N Vaghul said Azim Premji is an iconic business leader of the country. A Venkatramani, Mallika Srinivasan, M M Murugappan, Vikram S Kirloskar were among the other dignitaries present."
Satya Nadella tops Fortune’s businessperson of year 2019,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/11/20/satya-nadella-tops-fortunes-businessperson-of-year-2019/,"November 20, 2019",PTI,Business,"New York: Microsoft’s India-born Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has occupied the top spot in Fortune‘s Businessperson of the Year 2019 list, an annual compilation that also includes Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga and Arista head Jayshree Ullal.
Fortune‘s annual Businessperson of the Year list features 20 business leaders ”who tackled audacious goals, overcame impossible odds, found creative solutions”.
The list is topped by Nadella, who has been at the helm of the technology giant since 2014. ”In a year dominated by political chaos and bluster, it was a rare brand of steady — even quiet — leadership that won the day in the business world. And no one epitomises that brand of obsessively results-driven, team-based leadership more than our new No. 1 Businessperson of the Year,” Fortune said.
Banga is ranked 8th, while Ullal comes in at the 18th spot in the list for which Fortune looked at 10 financial factors ranging from total return to shareholders to return on capital. Both Banga and Ullal are of Indian-origin.
Fortune said Nadella, a computer scientist, was ‘neither a founder like Bill Gates, nor a big-personality sales leader like his predecessor, Steve Ballmer when he was named the ‘surprise choice’ to lead the Microsoft in 2014.
”He’d never worked in finance, another training ground for CEOs. And his stature on the global stage was non-existent. What’s more, having joined Microsoft in 1992, he was thoroughly steeped in a dog-eat-dog Microsoft culture that had contributed to the company’s stagnation,” Fortune said.
Today, Nadella ”wears the gaps in his resume as comfortably as the jeans and blazers that are his corporate uniform,” it said.
”Key to his leadership style is a willingness to delegate,” particularly to three members of his management team — president Brad Smith, who runs policy and legal affairs; Microsoft’s chief financial officer Amy Hood and chief people officer Kathleen Hogan.
”I am wired to be fairly confident in myself and to let others shine,’ Fortune quotes Nadella as saying. ‘CEOs can only do what they do if they have an amazing team. I am blessed to have that.”
On Banga, Fortune said, ”Thanks in part to Banga’s vision’, Mastercard has emerged as a ‘poster child’ for how legacy players in financial services can embrace and adapt to a rapidly evolving environment. In turn, the company has become a darling of the markets this year, with its stock climbing more than 40 per cent in 2019.”"

A press release here said, the panellists interpreted the draft guidelines and discussed the need to promote self-regulation in order to ensure transparency, accountability and help bring clarity to the Fantasy Sports industry.
Rameesh Kailasam said, “Such an effort would enable both the Centre and States to work in the direction of enabling this sunrise sector which is currently dependent on various court judgements for legitimacy to distinguish itself. With the absence of specific regulation, lack of policy clarity and discretionary interpretations by various State-wise regulatory regimes, the Online Fantasy Sports sector despite being acknowledged as a sunrise sector that engages with sports fans and enthusiasts suffers due to being misunderstood with many other forms of online games that are different. India also has a huge potential of creating more startups in this space that can take on the world”.

Offering challenge to dominance of Sony and Walt Disney-owned Star network in the cricket streaming and telecast space, Amazon Prime Video said it has purchased the India territory rights for NZC through the 2025-26 season.
As per the deal, Amazon Prime Video will be carrying live coverage of all Black Caps and White Ferns internationals across all three formats — ODI, T20 and Tests — starting from late 2021.
We are excited to add India’s most loved game — cricket, to our content selection for our Prime Video customers, and we are thrilled to work with NZC on this endeavour, Amazon Prime Video Director and Country General Manager, Gaurav Gandhi, said in a statement.
They have a strong, passionate and much-loved cricket team, and the cricketing rivalry between the two countries has been fantastic.

Fate of fantasy sports explained,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/11/07/fate-of-fantasy-sports-explained/,"November 7, 2020",NT Bureau,Sports,"Chennai: The Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS), India’s first and only self-regulatory industry body for Online Fantasy Sports Platforms (OFSP), has shared some ‘very interesting facts’ about the users and format of online fantasy sports platforms.
FIFS was founded in 2017 and is led by Bimal Julka, as chairman.Julka, in his previous role, served as the Chief Information Commissioner of Government of India and oversees the self-governance of Fantasy Sports sector in India.
Industry discussions and research reports such as the IndiaTech whitepaper have established that 80 per cent of the OFSP users prefer to participate in the free-to-play format. Statistics demonstrate that 99.60% of users who participate in a fantasy sports contest have either won or lost less than Rs 10,000 net on an Online Fantasy Sports Platform in their lifetime.
The average ticket size of participation in the pay-to-play format is usually as low as Rs 35. Online Fantasy Sports is a digital sports engagement platform that is dependent entirely on real-life sports.
It has become one of the primary sources of sports engagement for avid fans and matured users, primarily in the age group of 24 to 40 years. The very fact that it is dependent on actualities, seasonality, and availability of real-time sports matches makes it a non-addictive form of play, as stated in the IndiaTech report.
Interestingly, the time spent on the Online Fantasy Sports platforms is only limited to the time taken to draft the fantasy sports team. Participating in fantasy sports platforms also increases sports consumption as a sports fan follows teams, players, match conditions etc. more closely to be able to create a successful fantasy sports team.
Several leading sports bodies and leagues have partnered with Fantasy Sports platforms for meaningful fan engagement with the sport. Since the results of fantasy sports contests are purely dependent on the outcome of the real sporting event, there is no simulation and user can only participate in a fantasy sports contest right before the match start time of a live sporting event. This clearly differentiates OFSP as a non-addictive form of pure engagement with real-life sports.

But that long reach usually comes with a cost – extra weight and size.
The new L305 bucks the trend by being the world’s smallest and lightest 70-200mm f/4 lens.
With most 70-200mm lenses weighing 800g and measuring an average of 176mm in length, the L305 comes in a lighter and slimmer body that weighs 695g while achieving a 32 per cent reduction in length at just 119mm long.
In fact, the L305 by Canon is only marginally longer than the RF24-105mm f4L IS USM lens. This makes it easy to handle and carry around, and it can be stored in a bag while still attached to the camera, unlike other conventional telephoto zoom lenses which have to be removed from the camera before being stored away.

Sportsmen need to speak up on racism: Rabada,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/10/23/sportsmen-need-to-speak-up-on-racism-rabada/,"October 23, 2020",Agency,Sports,"New Delhi: A couple of days after Jason Holder said that he was disappointed to see Black Lives Matter (BLM) get ignored at the Indian Premier League (IPL) and other series, Delhi Capitals’ pace bowler Kagiso Rabada on Thursday said that sportspersons should spread the message of racial equality.
The fast bowler, a black player from South Africa, a country that was sanctioned for its white national government’s Apartheid policy and the country was banned from international sports competitions. The South African cricket team too did not compete in international cricket from 1970 to 1991.
It is important for people not to feel inferior. Liberation of mind is the most important thing. I think this is the message you want to spread especially as a sportsman when you do have a platform to express this. Lot of people follow what you do, because that is the nature of sportsman — there’s nothing different if I compare myself with every other person who hasn’t played cricket — but I am on a stage where people can now listen to me, Rabada told reporters during an interaction from the United Arab Emirates.
Rabada comes from a well-to-do family in Johannesburg and he would visit black impoverished neighbourhoods as youth to visit his extended family. That, he had said in the past, gave him a sense of perspective.
It is your responsibility at times to keep reminding that fighting for the right causes is important. Most importantly, I don’t want to shove my opinion or ideals down on anyone’s throats, he said.
It is just that if I am on this platform, I will express my opinion like I am now on this matter. Important for people to understand on political front that liberation is very important for human rights, and for humans to be treated with dignity is important, he said."
"Girls taking part in sports events can do wonders, says new study",https://newstodaynet.com/2020/10/02/girls-taking-part-in-sports-events-can-do-wonders-says-new-study/,"October 2, 2020",NT Bureau,Sports,"Chennai: A new research has found girls who actively participate in school sports events in middle childhood show improved behaviour and attentiveness in early adolescence.
The study, which was published in Preventative Medicine, confirms the benefits of extracurricular sport.
Linda Pagani, a professor at Université de Montréal’s School of Psychoeducation, said, “Girls who do regular extracurricular sports between ages 6 and 10 show fewer symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at age 12, compared to girls who seldom do.”
Pagani, who led the study co-authored by her students Marie-Josée Harbec and Geneviève Fortin and McGill University associate medical professor Tracie Barnett, said, “Surprisingly, however, boys do not appear to gain any behavioural benefit from sustained involvement in sports during middle childhood.”
As the team prepared their research, “it was unclear to what extent organized physical activity is beneficial for children with ADHD symptoms,’ recalled Pagani.
‘Past studies have varied widely in quality, thus blurring the true association between sport and behavioural development. On top of that, past research has not acknowledged that boys and girls are different in how they present ADHD symptoms.”
ADHD harms children’s ability to process information and learn at school, Pagani said. Sport helps young people develop life skills and supportive relationships with their peers and adults. It offers a chance to get organised under some form of adult influence or supervision.
“Thus, from a public-health perspective, extracurricular sport has the potential to be a positive, non-stigmatizing and engaging approach to promote psychological well-being and could thus be viewed as behaviour therapy for youth with ADHD,” Pagani added.

Chennai, Aug 22: The all-new BMW 3 Series, the power-packed seventh generation of the sports sedan, was unveiled yesterday in Gurugram. Locally produced at BMW Group Plant Chennai, the latest BMW 3 Series is now available in diesel and petrol variants at BMW dealerships across India.
“Driving pleasure”
Speaking at the launch, president & chief executive officer, BMW Group India, Rudratej Singh, said, “3 is the heart and soul of BMW. As the ultimate sports sedan, for over four decades, it has been the flag bearer of ‘Sheer Driving Pleasure’. In its new avatar, the 3 has outdone itself once again. Built for thrill and driven by technology, BMW 3 Series is an automobile that creates an impeccable harmony between the driver, machine and road.” He added, “Enthusiasts waiting for the perfect luxury sports sedan will be undoubtedly drawn to its new design, generous space, luxurious interiors and host of innovative technologies. Our current patrons, who swear by the unmatched driving character of the 3, will be equally thrilled with its enhanced best-in-class handling and agility.”
Digital magic
Making its debut in the 3 Series is the BMW Virtual Assistant, a digital personality of the vehicle that responds to voice commands. It sets a new benchmark for voice recognition. Drivers can operate a number of car functions simply by speaking to their BMW Virtual Assistant. It can be addressed by saying ‘Hey BMW’ or a customer-defined wake word, thereby adding an individual touch to the car.
In BMW Gesture Control, which is part of a rigorously thought-out operating concept, recognizes six pre-defined hand movements to control a number of functions. The spread of driver assistance systems is more extensive than ever. The Reversing Assistant provides support while reversing out of a parking spot or through narrow driveways. It keeps a record of the last 50 metres driven and assists by taking over the steering.
More the merrier
BMW 3 Series adapts perfectly not only to a dynamic lifestyle but also to personal taste. It is available in three design schemes – Sport, Luxury Line and M Sport. It is available in two diesel variants (BMW 320dSport and BMW 320d Luxury Line) and in one petrol variant (BMW 330iM Sport) which are locally produced. Customers can choose from a variety of service plans according to duration and mileage of their preference.

BMW India also offers service packages for older cars. Optional BMW Repair inclusive extends warranty benefits from third year of operation to maximum sixth year, after the completion of the standard two-year.
Faster, lighter
Despite larger dimensions, the car is now lighter than before, thanks to intelligent lightweight construction. A smart mix of materials in the car, such as aluminum in the bonnet, front side panels, front spring struts and engine sub-frame have led to a reduction of 55 kilograms. The interior is designed to accentuate cabin spaciousness and the driver-focused cockpit.
Extended shoulder and elbow room in the front and additional legroom and headroom in the rear contribute to a generous feeling of space. Filling up the cabin with a sense of spaciousness is the large glass sunroof. Through loading system includes rear seat backrests that can be divided in a 40:20:40 ratio for greater flexibility.
Power-packed
With BMW Twin Power Turbo technology, the petrol and diesel engines meld maximum power with exemplary efficiency and offer spontaneous responsiveness even at low engine speeds.The two-litre four-cylinder petrol engine of the BMW 330i produces an output of 258hp and maximum torque of 400 Nm at 1,550 – 4,400 rpm. The car accelerates from 0 -100 km / hr in just 5.8 seconds."

But due to rapid development in Santhoshapuram, Chennai, most of them have been converted into residential plots.
Concerned about the lack of playing spaces, Ashok A J, an IT employee and a resident of Santhoshapuram, has rented a playground for the purpose.
He made the call through a Facebook post, which read, “We had no money to buy that eight rupees stumper ball and new cricket bat. But we made coconut branch as bat and used paper and rubber band to make ball. We had lots of friends who are crazy about cricket like us and plenty of time to enjoy the summer evening. Those are lovely days. But today, we are in a position to buy 100s of balls and bat but finding no time to enjoy the summer evening. I am booking a cricket ground to play tennis ball cricket. Don’t worry if you are not a great player, just bring your family and friends and enjoy the pleasant summer evening.”
Following this, several residents approached Ashok and have been playing here for the past few weeks.
Speaking to this paper, Ashok said it has become tough to find space to play in recent times.
“Since most of us are IT employees, the only day we can relax is Sunday. We choose to play cricket on that day, only to find no grounds available. So, we decided to rent a place,” he said.
He noted that after booking the premises, he spread the word through WhatsApp and Facebook, where he received good response.
“I hope this also comes as a wake-up call to those who are not concerned about the lack of grounds for sports enthusiasts. Today, most people do no physical activity, which leads to various diseases,” he added.
He also said his initiative has enabled him to meet new people and make friends. “It will be helpful if the civic body builds a cricket ground for us to play,” he felt.

Sports films line up for release in Kollywood,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/09/sport-films-line-up-for-release-in-kollywood/,"May 9, 2019",M BHARAT KUMAR,Sports,"Sports and cinema never fail to win the admiration of youngsters. When it is a sports-centric film, the expectations go sky-high and the youth flock to theatres.
Be it Bollywood or Kollywood, fascination for sports genre has always been high. In tune with the trend, Kollywood is churning out nearly half-a-dozen sports films.
They include Vijay63, Susienthiran’s Kennedy Club and Vennilla Kabbadi Kuzhu 2, Jada, starring Kathir, and Jai’s untitled film with Gopi Nainar.
Interestingly, actor Jiiva is playing cricketer Krishnamachari Srikkanth in the Hindi sports film 1983, while Keerthy Suresh makes her Bollywood debut in Ajay Devgn-starrer that is about India’s popular football coach Syed Abdul Rahim.
Why the clamour for sports movies? Damodaran, a film-buff, says, “They have always appealed to the masses. Take the case of films like Chennai 28 or Irudhi Suttru. They were about underdogs winning against all odds. They strike a chord with young audience. They have no language barrier. The likes of Lagaan and Chak De were huge hits across the country.”
Vijay63, directed by Atlee, features Vijay in the role of a football coach. It speaks about a women’s team that goes on to win a championship.
Jada is  about football culture in north Chennai, while Jai’s film also speaks the same theme,  and  Susientharan’s Kennedy Club deals with a women’s kabbadi team.
According to Fazil, an industry tracker, “A sports film, too, needs commercial elements. There should be action, humour and emotion in it. Films like Chennai 28, Ethir Neechal and Irudhi Suttru succeeded because they were wholesome entertainers.”
Citing the example of recent-hit Kanaa, he says, “It spoke about father-daughter bonding with cricket as its base. It managed to woo the audience. Today it is being remade in Telugu.”
Even in Tollywood, sports films are a big draw. Nani’s recent release Jersey was an emotional drama. It spoke about how a middle-aged man pursues his dreams of playing cricket and emerges successful, he adds.
Content is the key. If the storyline is good and executed well, these movies will click, he said."

Chennai: The clock strikes 8 in the morning and John Edward Daniel walks to Railway Ground in East Tambaram to train his students.
They say age is a barrier for one to indulge in physical activities, but John proves it otherwise. He is also a role model to many capable retired people who are clueless about how to kill time.
At 61, the Selaiyur resident can be spotted walking briskly with his tracks on and whistling to his students to perform well. He trains and guides sportspersons – all without strings attached.
“I was naturally inclined towards sports back in my hometown, Dindigul, that led me to win accolades throughout school, college and also at work,” he told News Today, all the while giving instructions to his students.
Sharing more information about his interest, he adds, “There were not many sportspersons in the district as it lacked facilities. However, it did not deter my school and many were found excelling in events like football and hockey, among others. That sparked my desire to get into sports.”
John with his students after winning an event.
John excelled in all the events he participated in and won first place. He was particularly strong in athletics. Identifying his strength, his coaches advised him to refrain from contesting in other sports as it would lead to injuries.
“I slowly began withdrawing from other games and began focusing on athletics and made a mark up to class 12,” he explains.
However, things were not as rosy as it may sound now. He faced severe hurdles in the form of his parents. Being the first of five children, his parents wanted him to tread the beaten path – pursue engineering and have a secured life. An adamant John sneaked out to practise, going against his parents’ wishes.
Following this, with the help of a sports club in Madurai, he won the first place in long jump and triple jump.
For pursuing undergraduation, John relocated to Devakottai, where he continued to take part in competitions, won in several State-level championships and made it to the nationals in several instances; but he could not win.
When asked about it, he says, “Although I was able to excel, due to lack of sponsorship and not knowing the regional language, I had a tough time.”
Soon after this, he was offered a job at Chennai Port Trust and took part in events held within their pan-India circle. Life took a different turn and he became busy with his regular life. Not stopping with that, he was qualified to do umpiring in Commonwealth Games when it took place in India.
He reached his retirement age and wanted to do something for society. That is when John decided to train upcoming sportspersons without taking a penny in return.
“A majority of my male students have entered the police service and female students have made it big in their lives,” he recalls happily.
Wish John on 94440 40335."

Chennai: Chief Government Whip S Rajendran met Speaker P Dhanapal at the Secretariat today to discuss the next course of action following the resignation of Sports Development Minister P Balakrishna Reddy after his conviction in a 1998 case for damaging public properties that could see him spending time in jail for three years.
Rajendran met the Speaker before the Assembly session began. The meeting which lasted five minutes was done to instruct the Speaker to announce publicly in the Assembly that the Hosur constituency held by Balakrishna Reddy as vacant, sources said.
According to rules, this has to be informed officially to the Election Commission also and a by-election has to be conducted within six months in the Hosur constituency.
Hours after he was sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by a special court on Monday, Balakrishna Reddy resigned from the Edappadi K Palaniswami Cabinet. According to laws, in view of the conviction, the Minister stands automatically disqualified of being an MLA as per the provisions governing statutory disqualification of the Representation of People Act.
Convicted Tamilnadu Sports Minister, Balakrishna Reddy
However, allowing a memo moved by Reddy, trial judge J Santhi suspended the sentence enabling him to prefer appeal in the Madras High Court and tender a formal resignation. Reddy submitted his resignation to Chief Minister Palaniswami who forwarded it to Governor Banwarilal Purohit who has accepted it. His portfolio of Youth Welfare and Sports Development has been handed over to School Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan.
The issue pertains to a case registered in 1998 under the Tamilnadu Public Property (Prevention of damage and loss) Act for allegedly pelting government buses with stones and damaging them during a rally against illicit liquor in Hosur. Reddy was a member of the BJP then.
More politicos to follow?
The Special Court for cases against sitting and former MLAs and MPs which is barely four-months-old, has already earned a fearsome reputation for itself. Last month, it convicted a former DMK MLA M Rajkumar and handed down a 10-year jail term and on Monday, it dealt a severe blow to the AIADMK government by convicting Reddy.
Politicians like K N Nehru, who has about 10 cases listed against him, Coonoor MLA Shanthi Ramu, whose case is pending since May 2009, and former MLA Ravichandran, who faces murder charges, along with offenses punishable under the Arms Act and the Explosives Substances Act, are under the magnifying lens of the Special Court."

She said this in a WhatsApp message to mediapersons after a meeting with coaches appointed by the government in batches since 2010.
The meeting was to hear out the coaches’ grievances and also identify deficiencies in respect of various features of their appointment. All the coaches had reportedly not received their salaries for several months, she said. The 33 coaches who took part in the interaction were asked to respond to a questionnaire.
“Revelations by the coaches were truly disappointing,” she said adding they were all appointed without following any formal rules of recruitment. The Lt Governor further said they were absorbed with an annual contract and their salary was fixed in an arbitrary manner and the first batch was appointed in 2005. Three batches have been appointed so far.
“Increase in their salary is at the pleasure of the Sports Minister of Puducherry and aided by public officials,” Bedi said adding none of their annual contracts has been renewed since 2010. On several occasions they provided from their own resources the necessary equipment for students to play, she said.
Most of the coaches are in debt as they live on borrowed money or with the support of their friends and families, Bedi said. The Director of Sports has been handed a copy of all responses given by the coaches and asked to come out with a detailed response plan from the department to extend urgent relief to them. “All these issues should be examined by Department of Education before grant in aid is released”, she said."

She said whenever associations request for grants, they were being looked into so that the funds would help promote sports activities in a better manner. Earlier, she inspected the sports complex near here and said funds were available in limited manner.
“They (funds) should be used to promote sports,” she said, adding that she would hold discussions with coaches of different sports on Saturday.

2 per cent quota for sportspersons in govt jobs: CM Palaniswami,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/15/2-per-cent-quota-for-sportspersons-in-govt-jobs-cm-palaniswami/,"August 15, 2018",NT Bureau,Sports,"Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government was committed for the all-round development of the state, in lines with the policies of late J Jayalalithaa, Chief Minister K Palaniswami said today.
In his Independence Day address after unfurling the tricolour at the Fort St George here, Palaniswami also said the state was performing well in social and economic sectors.
“In order to honour the freedom fighters who had dedicated their lives for the cause of the country’s freedom, their pension will be increased from Rs 13,000 to Rs 15,000,” Palaniswami said.
Hailing the contribution of freedom fighters from Tamilnadu, he said, the family pension provided to their kin would be hiked from Rs 6,500 to Rs 7,500.
Though the 1857 sepoy mutiny against the British was said to be the country’s first war of independence, a similar revolt had happened in Vellore in 1806.
He recalled the contributions of various freedom fighters like local rulers Veerapandia Kattabomman, Maruthu brothers, poet Mahakavi Bharathi, C Rajagopalachary, K Kamaraj and EV Ramasamy ‘Periyar’ in the country’s independence struggle.
The Chief Minister also announced a two percent reservation in select government positions for sportspersons from the State who win medals in national level games or those organised by the State government.
This will also apply to those from Tamilnadu who win laurels in recognised international tournaments or even represent the country there, he said.
A high-level committee headed by the Chief Secretary will draw the guidelines for implementation of this quota in the state government departments or its run PSUs, he added.
Listing out the AIADMK government’s various achievements and proposals to ensure the state’s growth, Palaniswami said he has launched over Rs 22,000 crore worth projects so far, besides initiating Rs 16,000 crore worth ones.
The government was committed for all-round development in lines with the policies of the late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, he said.
The State was doing well in social sectors like education, with the enrollment in higher education touching 48.6 percent, making the state “no.1” in this aspect, he noted.
The government’s focus on a “second green revolution” with steps to achieve this had resulted in the foodgrains production crossing 100 lakh tonnes for five times between 2011-12 and 2017-18, he said.
In the IT sector, the state’s software exports for the year 2017-18 was estimated to be Rs 1,11,179 crore with about 6.38 lakh ‘experts’ involved in the sector, the Chief Minister said.
Underlining his government’s commitment for industrialisation efforts, he said works were on for the conduct of the second edition of Global Investors’ Meet in January 2019. Later, Palaniswami gave away various awards, including the Kalpana Chawla Award for Bravery.
It was awarded to I Muthumari, a labourer from Valparai in Coimbatore district. She was honoured with the award for “single handedly” attacking and chasing away a leapord in May this year after it entered her house and attacked her 11-year-old daughter.
The Dhaksha (UAV) Team, Centre for Aerospace Research, Anna University was given the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Award for the year 2018.

Djokovic entangles sponsors in Aus Open vax uproar,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/15/djokovic-entangles-sponsors-in-aus-open-vax-uproar/,"January 15, 2022",NT Bureau,Sports,"Melbourne, Jan 15: A lot of people are angry at Novak Djokovic. And his sponsors may just wait it out.
The world’s top-ranked men’s tennis player is the top seed and defending champion at the Australian Open. But it’s unclear if he can compete Monday after Australian officials again revoked his visa because he lacks a COVID-19 vaccine, leaving his attorneys to appeal his possible deportation.
The Serbian, known for his gluten-free diet and use of hyperbaric chambers, isn’t giving up the fight to seek his 21st Grand Slam. It’s his chance to overtake Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the men’s recordholder — and every brand loves a winner.
So far, there’s no sign Djokovic’s sponsors, including French automaker Peugeot, clothing brand Lacoste and Swiss watch maker Hublot, plan to drop him. He has $30 million worth of endorsement deals, according to Forbes, making him among the highest-paid athletes in the world. Still, he has never had the broad appeal of Federer, who makes triple the amount from endorsements despite losing his No. 1 crown years ago and being sidelined with injuries.
Federer’s squeaky clean image, underscored by his calm demeanour on court, has won him near universal adoration by fans and officials. Djokovic, meanwhile, has his brash moments like smashing his racquet and confronting referees, which some brands may be gambling is a hit with fans.
There is a line though, and one thing sponsors have to determine is whether an athlete acted illegally or immorally if they want to try to use a bad behaviour exit clause in a contract, said Tim Crow, a U.K. sports marketing consultant.
In Djokovic’s case, that’s pretty nuanced, Crow said. If he’s allowed to play, and wins, there will be even less pressure for sponsors to act.
‘He will be labeled as the most successful male player of all time, and I think that provides a reason for sponsors to be more willing to take that risk and remain with the athlete,’ said Ceyda Mumcu, professor of sports management at the University of New Haven.
Assessing the public relations aspect is complex. Fan opinion around Djokovic is polarized. He’s a national hero in his native Serbia. Australians have mostly turned against him, but the rest of the world is more divided, Crow said. If he had major health care companies as backers, they might have different reactions than a consumer-products company like a watch or auto brand. And COVID-19 vaccines are themselves divisive. What happened to Aaron Rodgers, the football player who got COVID-19 in November after misleading the NFL about his vaccination status, illustrates how different companies make assessments based on their brand values. He was dropped by a local health care company company. But a major backer, insurer State Farm, ramped his ad spots back up after briefly cutting back, according to an analysis by Apex Marketing Group.
Some of Djokovic’s sponsors tried to distance themselves from the situation and others, including Peugeot and Lacoste, declined requests for comment. But there was no sign any planned to cut ties. ‘Novak Djokovic is his own person,’ Swiss watch brand Hublot said. ‘We cannot comment on any of his personal decisions. Hublot will continue its partnership with the world number 1 tennis player.’ Austria’s Raffeissen Bank said its decision to sign Djokovic to a multiyear partnership was made long before the recent Australian Open headlines.
‘As Novak Djokovic’s sponsor, we are closely observing the current situation,’ the bank said. Sports fans rationalize athletes’ behavior if they are admirers — up to a point. It’s riskier if a transgression is tied to the actual performance of the sport, as in a doping scandal, or if it’s such an egregious criminal act that people all agree it’s wrong, said Americus Reed, professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Being against COVID-19 vaccines, or lying on paperwork, in our polarized world, may not rise to the level of nixing an athlete’s contract for bad behavior. Millions of people worldwide refuse to get vaccinated, despite assurances by public health authorities that they are safe and effective.
Still, ‘if you lose enough fans, then you’ll lose sponsors,’ said Nicole Melton, professor of sports management at University of Massachusetts Amherst."
Win in Aus is greatest in cricket history: Gavaskar,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/13/win-in-aus-is-greatest-in-cricket-history-gavaskar/,"January 13, 2022",NT Bureau,Sports,"Mumbai: Remembering India’s come-from-behind triumph in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2021 in Australia, former India captain and legendary batter Sunil Gavaskar stated that the series will go down as ‘one of the greatest wins’ in Indian cricketing history.
Gavaskar’s comments come ahead a docuseries titled ‘Down Underdogs – India’s Greatest Comeback’ that will premiere on of Sony Sports on January 14, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of India’s historic series win.
India, led by Ajinkya Rahane after Virat Kohli flew back home for paternity leave and many first-choice picks were unavailable due to injuries, defeated Australia 2-1 in a tightly-contested four-match series. After Australia won the day-night Adelaide Test, mainly on the back of bowling out India for 36, the tourists won in Melbourne, batted out for a nail-biting draw in Sydney and then staged a remarkable win at the Gabba in Brisbane.
India’s win in Australia early last year will go down as one of the greatest wins in Indian cricket history. To pick themselves up after the dismissal with their lowest ever Test score of 36 and then to beat a rampant home team is a tribute to the determination shown by the players and the leadership roles played by the captain Rahane, coach Ravi Shastri and his support group. I was privileged to be there and see a golden chapter being written in the history of Indian cricket, said Gavaskar.
The episodes of the docuseries are titled ‘The Adelaide Aberration, ‘Melbourne Magic’, ‘The Sydney Siege’ and ‘Brisbane Breached’.
Former Australia captain Michael Clarke applauded India’s showings in the Test series after the Adelaide debacle.
India picked an attack that worked. Different bowlers — not everyone bowls the same, different tactics, different skills, different weapons, so the credit goes to India for their execution but also Australia might have taken for granted their success in the first Test.
Apart from Gavaskar and Clarke, current Test players like Mohammed Siraj and Hanuma Vihari, who played decisive roles in India winning the series are featured."

Last year, Pandya was not retained by the Rohit Sharma-led MI ahead of the mega auction.
As per reports, Pandya, who hails from Baroda in Gujarat, will now be the captain of the Ahmedabad franchise, owned by CVC Capital. The official confirmation from the franchise is awaited.
Meanwhile, there are also reports coming in that former Indian seamer Ashish Nehra is likely to come on board as the head coach of the Ahmedabad franchise. Nehra, who retired from international cricket in 2017, had previously worked with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) as their assistant coach.
The Ahmedabad franchise is also looking to sign Afghanistan all-rounder Rashid Khan and former Mumbai Indians wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan.
CVC was one of two companies to have won bids to own the two new franchises that will play in the IPL from next season.
There was a delay in CVC getting the Letter of Intent from the BCCI as the company had come under the scanner over its alleged ties to betting companies after it won the Ahmedabad franchise in the auction that was held in Dubai in October last year.
The new teams have been given time until the end of the month by the BCCI to pick three players of their choice before the auction.
Meanwhile, following a sudden rise in Covid-19 cases in India yet again, there are several reports coming in that the Indian Premier League 2022, scheduled to take place in April, might move out of the country once again.
Meanwhile, a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official on Sunday said that the board is prioritising holding the tournament in India but the decision will be dependent on what the state governments decide.
As per a Sports Tak report, the board is monitoring the Covid-19 situation closely and no decision has been taken as of now with regards to venues for the tournament.
BCCI is exploring all options which include overseas IPL as well. But the focus is to host the IPL in India for sure. As of now the priority is the auction, and the board will soon take a call, it said.
The 2020 edition was entirely held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While the 2021 IPL was initially scheduled to be held in India behind closed doors, the league had to be postponed halfway through due to a rising number of cases within the bio-bubbles amidst the deadly second wave of the virus in the country.
It was then resumed and completed later in the year in the UAE.
Recently, the Indian cricket board recently postponed all upcoming domestic tournaments, including the Ranji Trophy, due to the pandemic."

India have never won a series in South Africa and Cape Town Test is their last chance this time around to fulful this long desire.
Good news India is that captain Virat Kohli will be back for third Test. He suffered a back spasm right at the star of the second Test and was not played. But the skipper is back and so is India’s selection headache.
Hanuma Vihari who replaced him did not do that bad in the second Test. The onus will be on the captain and management to make a choice between him, Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara ahead of the third Test.
Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir is backing Vihari and Pujara and wants Kohli to replace Rahane in the XI.
Speaking to Star Sports, Gambhir said, We have seen for a long time what performance Rahane has given. I believe when Virat Kohli comes in the next Test match, he bats at No. 4 in place of Rahane and Vihari bats at No. 5.
It’s the right move and right direction going forward as well because if the team management has backed Rahane so much, the time has come to back Hanuma Vihari as much because he has looked very solid in both innings, he added.

Djokovic thanks fans amid Australian visa row,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/08/djokovic-thanks-fans-amid-australian-visa-row/,"January 8, 2022",Agency,Sports,"Novak Djokovic
Melbourne: World No 1 Novak Djokovic on Friday broke his silence and thanked people around the world for their support amid a visa row over Covid-19 vaccines ahead of this month’s Australian Open.
Djokovic in his Instagram post on Tuesday said that he will be travelling to Australia with an ‘exemption permission’. But he was denied entry upon landing in Melbourne late on Wednesday and authorities cancelled his visa. The player’s lawyers then launched an appeal seeking to overturn the federal government decision, with a court agreeing not to deport him before a full hearing scheduled for Monday.
The 34-year-old is currently held in isolation at the Park Hotel in Carlton, Melbourne, awaiting the outcome of an appeal against the decision by the Australian Border Force (ABF) to cancel his entry visa and deport him. The appeal is set to be heard on Monday, a sky sports report said.
The reigning Australian Open champion has now broken his silence via Instagram.  Thank you to people around the world for your continuous support. I can feel it and it is greatly appreciated, Djokovic wrote in his Instagram story.
Thank you to my family, Serbia, and all good people across the world who are sending me support. Thanks to dear God for health, he added in Serbian.
Notably, the star player has never revealed whether he is vaccinated against Covid-19, but has criticised mandates ruling that players must be double-jabbed.
Meanwhile, Australia Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews maintained Djokovic was not being detained under any duress in the country.
Mr. Djokovic is not being held captive in Australia. He is free to leave at any time that he chooses to do so and Border Force will actually facilitate that. We treat all people who are in immigration detention fairly, equitably, Andrews told ABC.
A visa was granted for entry, but that does not guarantee entry. He (Djokovic), along with any other individual who is seeking to enter Australia, also has to meet the entry requirements which at this point includes medical evidence of vaccination or alternatively medical reasons why that individual cannot be vaccinated.
He hasn’t met the entry requirements — there is a lot of chatter about the visa, but that in my understanding is not the issue, it is the entry requirements…that he was not able to produce the evidence which was needed for entry into Australia, she added.
With his record nine titles, Djokovic is the most successful player in the history of the Australian Open. He is also in a three-way tie on 20 career Grand Slams titles with Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal in the all-time list.

London: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he hopes England can “ride out” the current wave of Covid-19 without further restrictions.
He, however, acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed amid a surge of Omicron cases, the BBC reported on Tuesday.
The Prime Minister said there was a good chance he would not impose fresh measures and would recommend continuing the government’s Plan B strategy in England to ministers on Wednesday.  He also announced plans for 100,000 critical workers to take daily tests.
The testing regime from January 10 will be for key industries including food processing, transport and the border force, in order to reduce the spread of the virus to colleagues.
The Prime Minister said at a Downing Street briefing he will recommend England sticks with Plan B restrictions, when cabinet ministers meet to discuss extending them.
The measures – which include working from home where possible, mask wearing in most public settings and Covid passports in some venues – are currently due to run out on 28 January.
As daily UK Covid case figures exceeded 200,000 for the first time with the spread of the Omicron variant, Johnson said people who believed the pandemic to be over were profoundly wrong.
The daily cases include a backlog of two days of cases from Wales and four days in Northern Ireland.
He said this was a moment for caution but also that the UK’s position was different from other waves, as Omicron is milder than previous variants and booster vaccines have been rolled out.
Johnson said the country had a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again.
We can keep our schools and our businesses open and we can find a way to live with this virus, he said.
Johnson acknowledged the weeks ahead would be challenging with some services disrupted by staff absences. But he promised to fortify the NHS to withstand pressure.
The assurances come as many industries are facing staffing problems over the number of workers self isolating with Covid or as contacts of cases, while many people have struggled to get tests over Christmas amid supply and demand issues.

Stokes should not be pushed into captaincy: Gower,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/05/stokes-should-not-be-pushed-into-captaincy-gower/,"January 5, 2022",NT Bureau,Sports,"London: Former England captain David Gower has said that Ben Stokes should not be pushed into the captaincy role as he has enough on his plate and hasn’t had a great comeback in the ongoing Ashes series in Australia.
With England having lost the Ashes after three successive defeats — Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne — there are calls back home in England to look for Joe Root’s alternative to lead the team. With Stokes enjoying a good rapport with team-mates, several former cricketers and critics are demanding the 30-year-old all-rounder be given the reins of the Test side.
Dissecting the England Test team leadership dynamics, Gower said on Tuesday that now is not the time for Stokes to be made captain.
(Ben Stokes) would make a good fist of it because he’s a very instinctive, strong character, and at the moment that’s the sort of character this England side needs, Gower told sen.com.au’s Sportsday on Tuesday. Whatever happens in the next two games (Sydney and Hobart), when they go home to the UK and start again, they’re going to need to find some new energy from somewhere, said the 64-year-old England great.
On the relationship between Root and Stokes, Gower said that the two were good mates and entirely loyal to each other.
In fact, Stokes had categorically said on Monday that he never had an ambition to be a captain, adding that Root should not be forced into relinquishing his captaincy in the wake of the Ashes debacle.
They are good mates as well. Ben, I can tell you, would be entirely loyal to Joe, said Gower. There’s no element of plotting behind the captain’s back here… He’s probably very happy for Joe to continue captaining.
Gower felt there was no use putting the pressure of captaincy on Stokes who had returned to the side for the Ashes after nearly six months of staying away from the game to resolve his mental health issues and finger injury. The all-rounder has been unimpressive with the bat and ball in the three Ashes games so far.
Stokes has a high score of 34 from six innings this series and has taken four wickets.
Ben Stokes at the moment, with this comeback, which hasn’t really gone as well as he would have liked so far, he’s got enough on his plate. I’ve always said with someone like Ben Stokes, you want that sort of de facto leadership in the room, having someone around like Ben around lifts the room and he can do that without being officially captain, he can do that without having to worry about all the other stuff, opined Gough."
I-League postponed for six weeks due to Covid ,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/04/i-league-postponed-for-six-weeks-due-to-covid/,"January 4, 2022",NT Bureau,Sports,"Mumbai: The All-India Football Federation (AIFF) and the participating clubs have unanimously decided to postpone the I-League 2021-22 for six weeks due to the rising cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant of the Novel Coronavirus.
The move was proposed during a meeting of the AIFF League Committee, chaired by Subrata Dutta, senior vice-president, held via video conferencing on Monday. The clubs unanimously ratified the proposal put forth by the AIFF.
The League will have a review meeting after four weeks to take stock of the situation, the AIFF informed in a release on Monday.
The proposal for postponing the league for six weeks was put forth by Dr. Harsh Mahajan, a member of the AIFF Sports Medical Committee.
Dr. Mahajan informed the clubs that with the number of positive cases rising all over the country exponentially, the new COVID norms and restrictions being implemented by the Government of West Bengal, and with AIFF not allowing any compromise with the health and safety of the players and officials, it’s prudent that the I-League 2021-22 be postponed by at least six weeks, a fact which was corroborated by all the participating clubs in the meeting.
The omicron variant spreads very fast but also comes down very rapidly. We also need to take into account and consider the government regulations and policies, Dr. Mahajan said.
The League Committee, abiding by the consensus of all the participating clubs as per the suggestion of Dr. Mahajan, ratified the decision to postpone the ongoing I-League 2021-22 for at least six weeks.
The protocol of the bio bubble will continue till January 7, as all teams will be tested again on January 5, and teams can travel back to their respective destinations once they are tested negative.
Players and officials who have tested positive in the team hotels who have already been isolated will be treated, and quarantined in Kolkata as per the health parameters laid down and will be allowed to leave the bubble after they test negative, the release said."
Editorial: No plaything,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/30/editorial-no-plaything-2/,"December 30, 2021",NT Bureau,Sports,"Though the sports we watch brought with them a façade of ‘back to normal’ as the pandemic-altered 2021 came to a close, a new reality took root this year: Every game, every practice, every season is a positive test or outbreak away from being postponed or compromised or cancelled.
Nobody can take any of this for granted anymore. That’s one of the many ways the Covid-19 pandemic carved away at the ‘old normal’ in 2021, a year in which sports came back from the total shutdown the coronavirus triggered in 2020 — but not quite in the way we remembered.
Take March Madness. After being scrubbed in 2020, the college hoops extravaganza returned. But even the term ‘March Madness’ lost a bit of its fun-loving insouciance when, thanks to a video posted on social media by Oregon’s Sedona Prince, the inequities between the men’s tournament, which used the moniker, and the women’s, which did not, were spelled out in stark terms. That led to a gender-equity study that called for a number of changes — in how the NCAA budgets for the tournaments and, yes, in what it calls them. The ‘March Madness’ brand now belongs to the women, too.
In another change with roots in the pandemic, the days of elite athletes being judged solely on the titles they win, the points they score or the medals they bring home appear numbered — if not gone for good. The face of that movement was gymnast Simone Biles, who, like so many other Olympians, extended her training an additional 12 months, while also enduring a year more of scrutiny and pressure in the leadup to the delayed Tokyo Games.
Overwhelmed by it all, Biles stepped away in the middle of the gold-medal team competition, and in doing so, changed the conversation for the rest of the Olympics, and the rest of sports. The words shouldn’t have needed saying, but they did. Combined with similar expressions from tennis champion Naomi Osaka, they slapped an exclamation point on a long-under-the-radar discussion about athletes and mental health. On the other hand, not every change or gain or loss in the 2021 return to sports had to do with Covid-19.

Right way to go: Shastri backs split captaincy,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/28/right-way-to-go-shastri-backs-split-captaincy/,"December 28, 2021",NT Bureau,Sports,"Mumbai: Former India coach Ravi Shastri has supported the splitting of captaincy in the red and white ball formats, saying it is the right way to go.
While Virat Kohli remains the Test skipper, one of the finest white-ball exponents and star opener, Rohit Sharma has been appointed as the T20 and ODI captain. ‘I think it’s the right way to go. This could be a blessing in disguise for Virat, and for Rohit, because I don’t think in this era if the bubble life exists for another year or so, one guy can handle all, that is not easy at all,’ Shastri, himself a former India all-rounder, said on Star Sports show ‘BOLD & BRAVE: THE SHASTRI WAY’.
Kohli, during his pre-departure press conference ahead of the tour of South Africa, said that he was never asked to stay on as T20 skipper when he made his intent clear on relinquishing the post.Shastri, who has served Indian cricket in various capacities, also said he wanted to establish Rohit as an opener.
‘It was very clear in my mind that I wanted to do it. I thought if I can’t get the best out of him as a batsman then I am a failure as a coach because there is too much talent there,’ said Shastri.
Meanwhile, the 59-year-old, who has played 80 Tests, also spoke about his relationship with Kohli, who was also the ODI and T20 skipper when Shastri was the head coach for a considerable amount of time.
‘We’re both pretty aggressive, we want to play to win. We realized very quickly that to win you need to take 20 wickets, deciding to play aggressive and fearless cricket. ”It meant at times you would lose games but once you got one across the line, then it’s infectious,’ said Shastri."

This was taught by Kapil Dev, when he led hiabside to victory in 1983 World Cup in England. The victory is sweet for Team India was as underdog with  everyone seeing them as minnows. The journey from.underdogs to champs by Kapil’s team has been recreated by Kabir Khan in 83. Ranveer plays Kapil while Jivva is cast as Srikanth and a bunch of artistes including Deepika Padukone playing pivotal roles.
India, who had only won a single World Cup match before the tournament, were deeply unfancied outsiders in 1983. Kabir  Khan frames the arrival in England of Kapil Dev, and other now legendary cricketers such as Sunil Gavaskar (played by Tahir Raj Bhasin) and Roger Binny (Nishant Dahiya), in jauntily comic underdog vein. With manager PR Man Singh by their side, the team created history. The movie chronicles the journey match wise with several back up and motivational stories. Fun, anger, agony and frustration are brought out well.
Ranveer lives as Kapil Dev. Not just in looks, but body language and suction too. He holds the entire movie together. And every other character including that of Cheeks played by Srikanth adds zing and excitement. The entire nation celebrating, soldiers at border in ecstasy, communal clashes ending because of WC triumph were brought out well. Sports breaks boundaries and unite people. Kapil proved it with WC triumph.
Three cheers to Ranveer, Kabir Khan and the rest. A wonderful recreation of marvellous moments from 1983 triumph."

Holding banners reading, Let us eat and Give us our frozen money, the protesters chanted slogans and marched down a central avenue, with the ruling Taliban providing security.
International funding to Afghanistan has been suspended and billions of dollars of the country’s assets abroad, mostly in the United States, were frozen after the Taliban took control of the country in mid-August.
The lack of funding has battered Afghanistan’s already troubled economy, leading to increasing poverty while aid groups warn of a looming humanitarian catastrophe. State employees, from doctors to teachers and administrative civil servants, haven’t been paid in months. Banks, meanwhile, have restricted how much money account holders can withdraw.
No country has yet officially recognised the country’s new Taliban rulers due to the armed group’s previous track record. The Taliban’s previous regime 20 years ago banned women and girls from education and public life, mandated beards for men and attendance at prayers, banned sports and entertainment and carried out public executions. But current Taliban government officials say their rule will be different, including eventually allowing education for all girls, and have called on the international community to release funds and help stave off a humanitarian disaster.

‘Maxwell should get more Test cricket opportunities’,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/18/maxwell-should-get-more-test-cricket-opportunities/,"December 18, 2021",NT Bureau,Sports,"Adelaide: Former Australian limited-overs cricketer David Hussey is surprised with the limited opportunities given to Glenn Maxwell in the Asian sub-continent despite the all-rounder being an asset in the white-ball games for the country.
The 33-year-old Maxwell has played just seven Tests since debuting in 2013, with the Cricket Australia selection panel citing his aggressive batting as the reason for his non-inclusion in the longest format.
But with the busy sub-continental schedule in 2022, where Australia plays Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and India in a variety of formats, Hussey, who is coach of Big Bash League (BBL) side Melbourne Stars, asked the selectors to give Maxwell more opportunities in Tests as well.
Maxwell averages 26 in Tests and it has been reported that the selectors will consider him to play Tests for Australia on the sub-continental tours.
Even Maxwell has been quoted as saying that he would like to be on the Test side. I think it’s definitely realistic (wanting to play Test cricket again). I think I’m probably playing as well as I ever have at the moment, he said recently.
Hussey told Sportsday on Friday that, I’m staggered by how little Test cricket he’s (Maxwell) played, especially in the sub-continent. Arguably, and I’m a little bit biased here, I think he’s one of the better players of spin in the country.
I know the upcoming winter we have got a lot of sub-continent tours ahead, so I do believe that he should be in all those touring squads. I think he should add to his (several) Tests for Australia, I think he’s in career-best form and it would be the wrong move to write him off now from playing Test cricket again.
Maxwell has played all his Tests in Asia with the last coming in 2017.
Meanwhile,  
Australia’s regular Test captain Pat Cummins has been allowed to fly to his home in New South Wales after missing the second Ashes Test at Adelaide, said Cricket Australia (CA) on Friday.
Cummins was ruled out of the Adelaide Test due to being deemed a close contact of a COVID-19 positive person while dining with fellow New South Wales and Adelaide Strikers fast bowler Harry Conway at Little Hunter Steakhouse on the eve of the ongoing Test.
Pat Cummins has been granted approval by SA Health to return home to NSW. Under the plan approved by SA Health, he will self-drive from isolation and then, with the appropriate PPE and hygiene controls, take a single charter flight, read a statement from CA.
Cricket Australia will continue to consult with SA Health to ensure compliance with the plan. He will continue to observe all isolation requirements in NSW. Cummins produced a negative test result on Thursday, further said the statement.
The news will be seen as a relief for the Australian team, who feared for Cummins being isolated in a hotel room for seven days, especially with the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne starting from December 26."

His remarks came in a video call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who said he looked forward to a get-together.
It comes as a growing number of countries have joined a diplomatic boycott of the games. This is due to alleged human rights abuses in China, which Beijing denies, the BBC report added.
I would like to point out that we always support each other when it comes to international sports cooperation, including our position against attempts to politicise sports and the Olympic Movement, said Putin in comments carried by state-owned media outlet The Global Times.
China has been accused of genocide in its repression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang – an allegation it has repeatedly rejected, the BBC reported.
China’s suppression of political freedoms in Hong Kong and concerns for Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, who was not seen in public for weeks after she accused a top government official of sexual assault in November are also among the diplomatic issues that have arisen, the report said.

Will miss his abilities a lot. He’s proven in England already that he’s really worked his Test game out, and the opening partnership was very important for us to play in that series. Obviously, with his experience and skill, we will miss those qualities, said Virat Kohli in a virtual conference. That said, it’s an opportunity for Mayank [Agarwal] and KL [Rahul] to step up and solidify that start for us and make sure the good work is carried on in this series, he added.
Rohit will be missing the upcoming Test series after the hamstring injury and Priyank Panchal was named as the replacement. Last week, Rohit was handed the reins of ODIs along with the T20I formats. Talking about Ravindra Jadeja’s absence due to a forearm injury, Kohli said that the all-rounder contributes to all three departments and the team will try to create the best combination possible in his absence.
Jadeja is a very important player for us, he contributes to all three departments, which is invaluable overseas, and he will be missed. That said, we do have the quality in the side to be able to create the best combination possible and still be able to win Test matches because we’ve created that bench strength and environment where people coming in are seizing opportunities, grabbing it with both hands, and making sure the team is helped by their performances. As much as we’ll miss him, it won’t be a deciding factor, said Kohli.
Meanwhile, a day after former Indian skipper Mohammad Azharuddin had tweeted about the alleged rift between Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports Anurag Thakur on Wednesday said there is no player bigger than the game.
Virat Kohli has informed that he’s not available for the ODI series and Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the upcoming test. There is no harm in taking a break but the timing has to be better. This just substantiates speculation about the rift. Neither will be giving up the other form of cricket, Azharuddin had tweeted.
  Sports is supreme and nobody is bigger than sport. I can’t you give information as to what’s going on between which players in what game. It’s the job of concerned federations/associations.

The Beijing Winter Olympic Games are scheduled from February 4-20,2022.
The IOC had to postpone the Tokyo Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to be held in July 2020, by a year and the Games were eventually held in July-August 2021.
Christophe Dubi,  the Olympic Games Executive Director, said he does not foresee such a situation because the Closed Loop system that the Chinese authorities have put in place for the Beijing Winter Games is very strong and capable of tackling any eventuality.
No (I don’t seen any such threat) Even though we have learned that in the case of Covid, we have to be flexible and be ready for every eventuality.
The Closed-loop system can control and tackle all situations, we are not saying that Covid will not move ahead but we have planned and worked out all scenarios. We have a very strong team in place there and the Closed Loop System is capable of handling all situations, said Dubi.
Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, said, For the Games to be successful, they have to be safe. The Closed Loop System that they are adapting at Beijing makes it very safe, he said.
Both Dubi and Samaranch Jr along with the IOC director of communication Mark Adams fielded questions on various issues on the opening day of the three-day IOC Executive Board meeting here on Tuesday.
Samaranch Jr expressed IOC’s disappointment over the decison by the United States of America (USA)of a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Games,terming it a political decision but said at least the sportspersons are free to participate in the Games.
All three assured that the Games will be safe for everyone as they will be held as per the Olympic Charter.
China has condemned a planned US diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and threatened to retaliate. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China would take resolute counter-measures but did not give further details. On Monday, the US said it would not send diplomats to Beijing over concerns about China’s human rights record. It added that US athletes could go and would have full government support.
At a media briefing on Tuesday,  Zhao accused the US of violating political neutrality in sport and said the proposed boycott was based on lies and rumours.
Tensions are high between both countries. The US has accused China of genocide in its repression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in the western region of Xinjiang – an allegation China has strongly denied.
Relations are also strained over China’s suppression of political freedoms in Hong Kong, and because of concerns for the Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, who was not seen for weeks after she accused a top government official of assault. The Women’s Tennis Association last week suspended all tournaments in China because of serious doubts about  Peng’s safety."
Chappell wants Root to bat No 3 in The Ashes,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/12/07/chappell-wants-root-to-bat-no-3-in-the-ashes/,"December 7, 2021",NT Bureau,Sports,"Sydney: Former Australia captain Ian Chappell has suggested England skipper Joe Root to bat at number three during the upcoming Ashes considering his good run of form in Test cricket this year.
Root has been the top run-scorer in Test cricket in 2021, amassing 1455 runs from 23 innings at an average of 66.13 while coming at number four. Overall, Root averages 53.37 at number four, as compared to 38.66 at number three. Root averages 38 in Australia with six half-centuries, compared to 50.12 with 23 centuries and 50 half-centuries in his overall Test career.
The question I would ask Joe is ‘why don’t you bat at three?’. I’ve always believed that you are better off coming in at one for not very many, than two for not very many. No one has really proved that they can really bat at three (for England), said Chappell on an Ashes preview program for Wide World of Sports (WWOS).
Joe has got all the credentials to bat at three, there’s never going to be a better time for him to bat at No.3 because he’s in terrific form, but he just won’t seem to bat at No.3. He might get lucky in Australia, and No.3 it could be (Dawid) Malan, and Malan I think’s a reasonably decent player. If Malan has a good series at three and keeps Joe away from the bowling for a while then it’s got a chance at working. But, I wouldn’t be trusting to luck, I’d be saying if I was Joe, ‘I’m batting at three’, added Chappell, who represented Australia in 75 Tests.
The 78-year-old further took a swipe at Root’s captaincy, saying that he would be heavily dependent on inputs from all-rounder Ben Stokes.
I wouldn’t worry too much about his captaincy, I don’t think that’s very good. He’s got an imagination problem that is important in Australia. His best chance with captaincy is if he takes quite a bit of advice from (Ben) Stokes, and Stokes establishes himself as a very aggressive player."

India Test and ODI skipper Virat Kohli admitted that the players have a lot of concerns on this issue, the bubble life and SOPs considering the ever-evolving situation and they are in regular touch with the Indian cricket board for information.
There are a lot of concerns worldwide over the detection of a new coronavirus variant called Omicron in South Africa and many countries have pulled out their sports teams from the country and many others have banned international travel to and from South Africa.
The Indian team is scheduled to fly out on December 9 on a chartered flight and the BCCI has maintained that the tour is currently on and that they are in constant touch with Cricket South Africa and the Indian government regarding the developments.
Amidst reports that the tour may be delayed by a few days, Kohli said that they are waiting for clarity from the BCCI. He said the players do have concerns regarding the tour, the new variant of Covid-19, the restrictions that would be in place, and that chief coach Rahul Dravid has initiated a discussion in the team to understand their concerns and communicate them to the BCCI.
It’s pretty clear that we are not playing in normal times. There are a lot of things, a lot of concerns among players, especially those who are coming into the squad as they want to know about bubble life, the various restrictions. Rahul (Dravid) bhai has initiated a conversation in the group regarding this and is also in touch with BCCI regarding the concerns of the players.

India A will start their second unofficial Test against South Africa A in Bloemfontein on Tuesday, staying put in the country despite the global trepidation that has followed the Omicron variant’s discovery.
The Indian senior team will compete in three Tests starting December 17, followed by as many ODIs and four T20 Internationals.
Virat Kohli and his men are scheduled to land here by December 9 but there have been some concerns about the tour due to the Omicron variant’s discovery in the region which has led to travel restrictions by several countries.
‘South Africa will take all precautions necessary to ensure the health and safety of the Indian teams. A full Bio-secure environment will be established around both the South African and Indian ‘A’ Teams as well as the two National Teams,’ the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), which is the country’s foreign ministry, stated.
‘India’s decision to show solidarity by choosing to continue with the tour of the Indian ‘A’ Team stands in contrast with a number of countries who have decided to close their borders and to restrict travel from Southern African…,’ it added.
The ministry said that the South African government has expressed its appreciation to the BCCI for allowing the tour to continue and ‘for not letting travel restrictions negatively impact on international sports.’ The first India-South Africa Test will be played at Johannesburg, followed by the second match at Centurion (December 26) and the third match at Cape Town (January 3).
‘The tour of the Indian National Team marks the 30th anniversary of South Africa’s readmission to international cricket.’ In 1991, India had become the first country to host a South African team after the country was banned from international cricket in 1970 by the International Cricket Council (ICC) due to the then South African government’s apartheid policy.
‘The anniversary will be celebrated by a commemorative event that will take place on January 2, 2022 in Cape Town. This event will also serve to highlight the strong ties between South Africa and India, which is once again demonstrated by the tour of the two Indian teams,’ the ministry statement read."

Shreyas Iyer again stole the show in his debut Test match with his knock of 65 helping India in a position of command on day four of the Kanpur Test. Taking to Twitter, Saha wrote, Success is not in what you have, but who you are. Glad to contribute to the Team’s cause. @BCCI.
Coming back to the match, the visitors now find themselves in a spot of bother ending on 4/1 and needing 280 runs to win on the final day. India on the other hand, will be confident of taking the nine wickets required for a victory on a pitch that is assisting their spinners.
Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer said that his strategy while playing against New Zealand was to focus on the ‘present’ and play as many balls as possible.
I had been in this situation before as well, not with the Indian team but with my Ranji team. The mindset was to play the session and play as many balls as possible. I wasn’t thinking too far ahead, was just focusing on the present. (On being the first Indian to score a ton and a fifty in debut Test) Yeah, I knew about it. When I came back, one of my teammates told me about it. Yeah, many others have done it from other teams but I was told I am the first from India.
It feels good but the most important thing is to win the match, Shreyas Iyer told host broadcasters Star Sports after the Stumps on Day 4. Rahul Sir had told me to bat as many balls as possible and I was determined to do that. We felt that 250 including the first-innings lead would have been a good score, so we’re very happy with where we are now. Actually, not a lot was happening with the wicket today, the ball was keeping a bit low. The talk was to get to a competitive total and I feel that it’s a really good total. We have real spin power, so hopefully, we can get the job done, he added."

Manchester United’s 3-0 thrashing of Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Saturday was the perfect antidote after being left disappointed and under some pressure after a heavy defeat by Liverpool last week, forward Cristiano Ronaldo said. United came into the contest in north London on the back of a 5-0 hammering by their bitter rivals Liverpool that heaped the pressure on manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but goals from Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani and Marcus Rashford sealed a comfortable win.
We knew before the game that we had a tough week after a result that we didn’t expect,” Ronaldo told Sky Sports. The team was a little bit under pressure, a little bit sad, but we knew we could give a good answer. “We played good, started well. Of course my job is to help the team with my experience, my goals, my assists and I did that and I feel so pleased. In terms of the team, it was an unbelievable performance.
Ronaldo, who scored a superb volley before setting up Cavani in the second half, said he was delighted the team could snap a poor run of four games without victory. The criticisms are always there, Ronaldo said. “It doesn’t bother me because I have played 18 years of football, so I know that one day people will say ‘we’re perfect’ and another day they will say ‘we’re crap’.
I know that and we have to deal with that, but it’s always better when the people praise you and they are happy with you. Sometimes life is like that, sometimes we have to pass through bad moments and we have to change and we changed today. United rose to fifth in the standings with 17 points from 10 matches.

Waqar apologises after controversial remark,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/28/waqar-apologises-after-controversial-remark/,"October 28, 2021",NT Bureau,Sports,"Islamabad: Former Pakistan pace bowler Waqar Younis on Wednesday tendered an apology with folded hands for the controversial remark he made after the Babar Azam-led side defeated India by 10 wickets in the ICC T20 World Cup ‘Super 12’ game on October 24.
Younis, who is also the Pakistan cricket team’s former bowling coach and resigned just a month before the start of the ICC T20 World Cup, was slammed by former India cricketers and commentators for his controversial statement that opener Mohammad Rizwan offering namaz in front of Hindus (during the match) was very special to him.
But on Friday, Younis posted an apology on social media, saying, In the heat of the moment, I said something which I did not mean which has hurt the sentiments of many. I apologise for this, this was not intended at all, genuine mistake. Sports unites people regardless of race, colour or religion. #apologies (Folded hands symbol).
Former India cricketers Venkatesh Prasad, Aakash Chopra, and noted commentator Harsha Bhogle had slammed Younis after he made the controversial remarks on a TV programme.
Rizwan, who emerged as the protagonist in Pakistan’s historic win over India at the ICC World T20, had offered ‘namaz’ during the drink’s break in Dubai. A video of Rizwan offering ‘namaz’ during the drinks break of the match on Sunday went viral.
In a conversation with Shoaib Akhtar and a Pakistani journalist, the former Pakistan bowling coach said that Rizwan performing ‘namaz’ during the match was a special moment for him.
Sabse ache baat jo Rizwan ne ki. Usne ground mein khade hoke Naamaz padhi, hinduon ke beech mein…So that was really something very, very special for me. (What I liked most is what Rizwan did. He stood in the middle of the ground and read the prayers, in front of the Hindus), Waqar was quoted as saying by Arya News.
Waqar’s remark did not go down well with fans and irked several former Indian cricketers as well.
Reacting to his remarks, former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad called Waqar a shameless man. Hinduon ke beech me khade hoke namaaz padi, that was very, very special for me – Waqar. Takes jihadi mindset of another level to say this in a sport. What a shameless man, tweeted Prasad.
Noted Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle also took to Twitter and labelled the statement of the former cricketer as one of the most disappointing things he has heard lately.
For a person of Waqar Younis’s stature to say that watching Rizwan offering namaz in front of Hindus was very special to him, is one of the most disappointing things I have heard. A lot of us try hard to play such things down and talk up sport and to hear this is terrible, Bhogle shared a lengthy thread about Younis’ controversial statement on Twitter.
You would think that cricketers, as ambassadors of our game, would be a little more responsible. I am sure there will be an apology on the way from Waqar. We need to unite the cricket world, not divide it by religion.
I really hope that a lot of genuine sports lovers in Pakistan are able to see the dangerous side to this statement and join in my disappointment. It makes it very difficult for sports lovers like us to try and tell people it is just sport, just a cricket match, he added.
Taking cognizance of Waqar’s remarks, cricketer turned commentator Aakash Chopra also tweeted, Et tu, Waqar!"

Six bowlers on a flat wicket would be ideal: Agarkar,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/20/six-bowlers-on-a-flat-wicket-would-be-ideal-agarkar/,"October 20, 2021",NT Bureau,Sports,"Dubai: Former India paceman Ajit Agarkar feels that skipper Virat Kohli would like to go in with six bowlers — three of them seamers — on the relatively flat pitches in the UAE, when India begin their ICC T20 World Cup campaign against arch-rivals Pakistan on October 24.
While the batting line-up is more-or-less decided, it’s the bowling department which will need to be tailored to suit the pitch, and Agarkar feels that if the wicket has something to offer, Kohli could perhaps take a chance with five bowlers.
Relatively certain that Virat Kohli would like six-bowling options. If the pitch has something to offer, then you can perhaps take a chance with five bowlers, but if it’s a flat pitch, he would ideally want to go in with six bowlers with three seamers and they have lots of spin options, Agarkar said on Star Sports on Tuesday.
And Jadeja is an all-rounder whose batting has come out in leaps and bounds. So, you can treat him as one of the top-order batsmen. So, my six options — if Hardik Pandya is not to bowl — would be Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Shardul Thakur, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakravarthy and Rahul Chahar, added Agarkar.
India wicketkeeper-batsman Parthiv Patel said that by now Kohli would have figured out the combination he would like to have, though he would not have made up his mind on the players who would play.
I am sure Virat knows his playing XI and probably not the names, but I am sure he knows what combination he wants to go with. To me, the question will be, should you play Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Shardul Thakur.
Probably Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul to open, Virat at No.3, Suryakumar Yadav at No.4, Rishabh Pant at No. 5, Hardik Pandya — even if he is not bowling, he is picked as someone who can finish the game — Ravindra Jadeja, Rahul Chahar, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah and the last choice will be between Shardul Thakur and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, said Patel."

It was a mixed day for India in the BWF World Tour Super 1000 event as Kidambi Srikanth and Sameer Verma too advanced in singles as did the doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty but B Sai Praneeth and the doubles pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy lost in the opening round of the main draw.
Sindhu, who was on a sabbatical since the Tokyo Olympics ended in August, romped to a 21-12, 21-10 win against the Turkish opponent in the women’s singles first-round match played at court 3 at Odense Sports Park.
Sindhu, who is ranked 7th in the BWF rankings as compared to Neslihan’s 28, was too strong for her opponent and took an early lead in the first game. She maintained her grip on the game and there were no first match jitters as she dominated the second game too, winning it on her second game point.
Srikanth defeated compatriot Sai Praneeth in straight games, winning the all-Indian affair 21-14, 21-11 in 30 minutes. He maintained a strong grip on the match from the start and did not allow Sai Praneeth many chances, earning five match points in the match.

During the recently concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021, Pandya did not bowl throughout the season and managed to score just 127 runs at a strike rate of 113.39 for the Mumbai Indians.
To this, the cricketer-turned-politician Gambhir said that Pa’dya’s poor form with the bat in the lucrative league means that he cannot have a spot in the Indian team if he is not bowling.
‘For me, Hardik Pandya gets into India’s playing XI only if he does proper bowling in both warmup games, not only in the nets, said Gambhir on Star Sports. There is a huge difference between bowling in the nets and against quality batsmen like Babar Azam and that too in the World Cup.’
He has to bowl in the practice matches and the nets, and he has to bowl 100 percent. If you are thinking that you will come and bowl just at 115-120 kph, I will not take that risk, he added."

In a post-match discussion on Friday, Dhoni had said that it is up to the Indian cricket board (BCCI) and how they shape the rules for the auction next season that will decide whether he will be involved with CSK as a player next season.
MS will be the first man to be retained, there is no doubt about it. But first of all, we need to know the retention rules, which we are not aware of as of now. If we can retain (players), Dhoni will be first to save, a CSK official was quoted as saying.

Aussies have a chance to win WC: Hussey,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/18/aussies-have-a-chance-to-win-wc-hussey/,"October 18, 2021",NT Bureau,Sports,"Dubai: Former Australia batter Mike Hussey is optimistic about his country’s chances at the men’s T20 World Cup in the UAE and Oman. Despite Australia not winning a T20I series since February 2020 and losing the series to England, India, New Zealand, West Indies, and Bangladesh, Hussey feels that Australia can do well if they adapt to the UAE conditions.
I’m actually pretty optimistic about Australia’s chances. I think we’ve got a really good team, a dangerous team. If they can get their confidence up, adapt well to the conditions, then I think it’s a pretty darn good team. Hopefully, they can get on a roll, Hussey told foxsports.com.au on Sunday.
Hussey was in praise of all-rounder Glenn Maxwell, who was in great nick for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the recently concluded IPL 2021 in the UAE. Maxwell had scored 513 runs, including six half-centuries in 15 matches for Bangalore at an average of 42.75 and a strike rate of 144.10 to be the fifth-highest run-getter in IPL 2021.
‘He’s been great to watch. He’s been on fire. He’s been confident and the good thing is it’s in those conditions in the UAE (he has performed). So hopefully he can carry his IPL form into the World cup becaose he’s going to be a critical member of the team. It’s a tough role to play there in the middle order in T20 cricket so if you’ve got someone who’s in top form and on top of their game then we’ve seen he can be a match-winner on his own.’

Japan’s hopes in danger after loss to Saudi Arabia,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/08/japans-hopes-in-danger-after-loss-to-saudi-arabia/,"October 8, 2021",NT Bureau,Sports,"Tokyo: Japan surprisingly lost 1-0 to Saudi Arabia to leave its chances of a seventh successive World Cup appearance hanging in the balance.
Japan has now lost two of the first three games in Group B to sit six points behind Saudi Arabia and leader Australia, who both have the maximum nine. The top two from both six-team groups qualify for next year’s tournament in Qatar automatically.
Substitute Firas Al-Buraikan scored the winner in the 71st minute in Jeddah after he ran onto a wayward backpass from Gaku Shibasaki to fire a low shot past Shuichi Gonda in front of 45,000 fans at King Abdullah Sports City Stadium.
Australia defeated Oman 3-1 in Doha to stay on top of the group on goal difference and record an 11th successive qualifying victory, which Football Australia says is a FIFA record for a single qualifying series.
Football Australia said the win moved Australia past Germany, Spain, and Mexico, which each won 10 consecutive matches on their way to qualifying for Russia 2018, South Africa 2010, and Germany 2006, respectively.
Australia’s string of wins dates to September 2019 when the Socceroos’ quest to qualify for Qatar 2022 started in Kuwait City. En route to securing the global record, the Socceroos have kept eight clean sheets, outscoring their opponents 35 goals to three.
Due to scheduling, combined with the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, all except one of Australia’s matches throughout the period have been played on foreign soil. The Socceroos’ sole match in Australia throughout qualification for Qatar 2022 came in October 2019 against Nepal in Canberra, a 5-0 win for the home side.
‘It’s something we’ll probably reflect on in the future and what a great feat it has been, especially playing 10 out of 11 games away from home, but to me it’s all about going to Japan and getting ready for Japan in Japan and making it 12 (wins), Australia coach Graham Arnold said.
Australia next plays Japan on Tuesday at Saitama near Tokyo.
Awer Mabil’s ninth-minute opener was canceled by Mandhar Al-Alawi just before the half hour. Martin Boyle restored Australia’s lead early in the second half and Mitchell Duke added a late third goal to keep the Socceroos on course for a fifth successive World Cup.
China kept its faint hopes alive with a 3-2 win over Vietnam. Both teams had lost its first two games but Wu Lei scored his second deep into injury time after Vietnam had come back from two goals down to level the score.
Son Heung-min’s late goal gave South Korea a 2-1 win over Syria to keep his team unbeaten. Son scored from close range with one minute remaining to put South Korea on top of Group A after three games.
It looked to be a frustrating evening for the Koreans, who dominated.
After a wasteful first half in which forward Hwang Hee-chan missed three good chances, they finally took the lead soon after the break.
Hwang In-beom twisted and turned outside the area and unleashed a fierce shot into the bottom corner of the Syria goal."

London: Former England captain Andrew Strauss feels that the Ashes scheduled for the end of the year needs to go ahead. He added that the cricket boards of England and Australia will find a way out to accommodate families of the players.
To me, the Ashes need to go ahead. We are learning to live with Covid in this country and Australia is in a slightly different place. But the Ashes means a lot to a lot of people, and some of them are people that are going through a tough time themselves. It defies belief that all these other sports are taking place and that the Ashes doesn’t take place. There is a way of making it happen and I think we are moving in the right direction. I think there will be accommodations made and that families will get out there, Strauss was quoted as saying by Daily Mail on Sunday.
Personally, I think if you are selected on an Ashes tour, you should go. An Ashes tour is not the one to pull out of, in my opinion. But I understand that everyone sees things slightly differently. But I think that between Cricket Australia, the Australian government and the ECB, they will find a way that works for both the players and their families, added Strauss.
Strauss, who led England to Ashes victory in Australia in 2010/11 and also served as a former director of cricket for the ECB, is of the opinion that England need to put up a better show than they did during the home Tests against New Zealand and India even if all first-choice players are available.
I think we are going to have to play a lot better than we did this summer, put it that way. Our top order needs to function better than it has done for a long time. Playing against the new ball in Australia is a very tough thing to do. There will be a lot of responsibility on our bowling attack. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad will have a role to play but we can’t just rely on them to win us the Ashes.
The 2021/22 Ashes will take place from December 8, 2021 to January 18, 2022. Australia are the current holders of the Ashes. The five-match series is also a part of the 2021 to 2023 cycle of the World Test Championship (WTC).

This guy (Shubman Gill), he is a bit unlucky. If you look at him bat, he is in some form, alright. And I believe he’s just a match away from a big score.

Though Mumbai Indians defeated Punjab Kings by six wickets at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, Suryakumar’s poor run continued, and with Ishan Kishan too being dropped due to performance-related issues, Lara came down heavily on both the cricketers for not showing the right intent.
Both the cricketers are a part of India’s ICC T20 World Cup squad to be held in the UAE and Oman in October-November this year.
Maybe Indian selection (one of the reasons for the dismal showing). A lot of guys maybe are sitting back on their laurels now. They remember the Indian team, something may be more important. But this is where your bread and butter is. Playing the IPL, this is where you have done it. Looking at Suryakumar, looking at Ishan Kishan, looking at (Saurabh) Tiwary, he looks hungrier than they are, Lara said on Star Sports on Tuesday.
Even as Suryakumar was bowled for a duck, Saurabh Tiwary made a 37-ball 45 and played a key role in Mumbai Indian’s run chase on Tuesday.
The 31-year-old Suryakumar, who looked in fine touch when the India’s second team under Shikhar Dhawan toured Sri Lanka in July for a limited-overs series, has scores of 0, 8, 5 and 3 in the four matches he has played in the IPL’s second leg. Kishan too has had dismal scores of 11, 14, and 9 in the UAE before he was dropped for the Punjab Kings match on Tuesday.
For me, those guys have to be a little bit more professional now and try to help their team win the tournament. Forget the World Cup, this is your job now to get MI back into the tournament, Lara added."

Whatever the format, Kohli is aggressive in his outlook and likes taking the game to the opponent. Most of his teammates feed on his aggression.
In a set up like the Indian Premier League (IPL) where each team has many young and uncapped players who look up to the stars to model their game on, an aggressive player like Kohli makes a huge impact.
That is the reason why the Royal Challengers Bangalore want Kohli to continue to be aggressive, says former South Africa and RCB pacer Dale Steyn.
Speaking exclusively on Star Sports’ live feed of select dugout, Steyn said,  think the guys prefer to see him be more aggressive, it seems to get him to play a bit more fluently. It kind of sparks the younger players too, a lot of the younger guys have massive respect for Virat, and they admire him so much that they kind of follow in his direction.
When he’s fighting fire with fire and nobody’s doing it for India, you can hear all the quicks, when they were playing against England recently, how they were talking about following their captain and they wanting to play fighting fire with fire. So, he does lead from the front in that aspect and RCB love it. He’s kind of built that thought around RCB now. It’s the kind of culture that they have got in that dressing room.
Royal Challengers Bangalore have recovered from their defeat to Chennai Super Kings to beat Mumbai Indians on Sunday and are hoping to cement their place in the knockouts as early as possible.
Kohli played a captain’s innings of 51 against Mumbai Indians and was aggressive with his bowling changes in as well as fielding. And the players capitalised on that as  they beat Mumbai Indians easily.
Kohli has already decided that the present season will be his last as a T20 captain as he has decided to quit captaincy both of the national team as well as that of RCB."

Manika Batra vs TTFI: Big win for Indian paddler,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/24/manika-batra-vs-ttfi-big-win-for-indian-paddler/,"September 24, 2021",Agency,Sports,"New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Thursday (September 23) stayed the Table Tennis Federation of India’s mandate on compulsory attendance at the National Coaching Camp in order to be selected for any upcoming international event and asked the Centre to conduct an inquiry into Manika Batra’s complaint against the sports body.
Justice Rekha Palli further said that if warranted, the Union Sports Ministry may look into the affairs of the TTFI as well.
Justice Palli was hearing a plea by Batra who was left out of the Indian contingent for the upcoming Asian Table Tennis Championships and has alleged that the national coach Soumyadeep Roy ‘pressurized’ her to ‘throw away’ an Olympic qualifier match in favour of one of his personal trainees.
The judge said the rule mandating compulsory attendance at the national camp has been enforced ‘at a point when there was a complaint pending against the national coach’ and the same ‘does not inspire confidence’."

Nortje and Rabada know how to bowl to David Warner. I think Rabada has knocked him over 4-5 times already. So they know and understand how to bowl to Warner. I am not surprised actually. I think this was a real tough game for Warner Pietersen said on Star Sports.

Kohli will continue to play with the same intensity: Agarkar,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/22/kohli-will-continue-to-play-with-the-same-intensity-agarkar/,"September 22, 2021",Agency,Sports,"Mumbai: Former India pace bowler Ajit Agarkar feels that Virat Kohli will continue to play with the same energy and enthusiasm despite deciding to step down from T20 captaincy after the T20 World Cup and the IPL 2021 season.
I think one of the things we’ve seen throughout his career, even when he wasn’t the captain and when he played under MS Dhoni quite a bit, the energy and the passion still seemed the same. I can’t imagine it changing just because he’s not the captain and just being one of the guys, Agarkar said on Star Sports after RCB’s nine-wicket loss to KKR on Monday night.
Kohli recently decided to step down as India’s T20 skipper after the ICC T20 World Cup in Dubai and Oman in October-November and also said he was relinquishing his RCB captaincy after the 2021 IPL season.
Former India wicketkeeper-batsman Parthiv Patel said Kolhi must be feeling relieved after relinquishing the RCB captaincy given the workload coupled with prolonged stays in bio-bubbles.
I think he looked more emotional than happy. I think when you’re playing for one franchise for so many years, you get that emotional connect which was there in RCB. I think RCB actually invested in Virat Kohli’s talent in 2008 and then showed a lot of trust in him as well because if you look at his and RCB’s journey, it has been a rollercoaster one.
But yeah, he might be relieved because see moving around from one bubble to another can take a load on you and he has spoken about the workload and intensity, which he plays with. I think every practice session, every match session or gym session, he does it with full intensity and that’s something I’m sure he must’ve thought about."

Taliban bans IPL 2021,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/21/taliban-bans-ipl-2021/,"September 21, 2021",Agency,Sports,"Kabul: Fans of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021 in Afghanistan will have to give the T20 league a miss this season, as the new Taliban regime have banned it’s telecast. The IPL 2021 resumed in the United Arab Emirates – an Islamic state – on Sunday (September 19) with a game between Chennai Super Kings and defending champions Mumbai Indians.
The UAE leg of the IPL 2021 will not be telecast in Afghanistan due to possible ‘anti-Islam contents’ that could be aired during the programming. Afghanistan are now under the control of the Taliban regime.
Top Afghanistan cricketers like Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi and Mujeeb ur Rahman are taking part in IPL 2021. The Taliban have banned most forms of entertainment — including many sports – and women have been completely banned from playing sport. Former Afghanistan Cricket Board media manager and journalist, M Ibrahim Momand, sent out a tweet stating that due to possible anti-Islam content, girls dancing and the attendance of barred hair women in the Islamic Emirates of the Taliban, IPL broadcast is banned in the country.
Even though the hardline Islamists have shown they do not mind men playing cricket, pulling together a match in the capital Kabul shortly after foreign forces withdrew, Bashir Ahmad Rustamzai, Afghanistan’s new director-general for sports, had last week declined to answer as to whether women will be allowed to play sports — deferring it for top-level Taliban leaders to decide. The takeover has called into question the future of Afghanistan’s participation in Test matches, as under International Cricket Council regulations, nations must also have an active women’s team.
Earlier, Australia’s cricket chiefs threatened to cancel a historic maiden Test between the two countries — set to take place in November — after a senior Taliban official went on television to say it was ‘not necessary’ for women to play."

Islamabad: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that his country had to endure a terrible relationship with the US which turned out to be disastrous for Islamabad.
In an interview with CNN, Khan also called out the US for repeatedly accusing Pakistan of harbouring terrorists, Dawn news reported.
What are these safe havens? The area of Pakistan along the border of Afghanistan had the heaviest surveillance by the US drones, surely they would have known if there were any safe havens?
The premier said that Pakistan was unable to take military action against the Afghan Taliban because they were not attacking Pakistan.
Pakistan had its own internal matters to look at, such as attacks from the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He said that had he been in the government at that time, he would have taken a different course of action.
I cannot destroy my country to fight someone else’s war, he said. My responsibility would have been to the people of my country.
Khan also said that he did not speak to US President Joe Biden after the Taliban took over Afghanistan. He did not call as he is a busy man, the Prime Minister added.
When questioned whether he supports the Taliban’s treatment of women, especially excluding them from sports, Khan said: I feel very strongly that it is a mistake to think that someone from the outside will give Afghan women their rights (because) Afghan women are strong. Give them time, and they will get their rights.
With regards to women having the same rights as men in public and private lives, he said: Women should have the ability in society to fulfil their potential in life (but) you cannot impose women’s rights in Afghanistan from abroad.

Chris Gayle has to open the batting: Gambhir,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/16/chris-gayle-has-to-open-the-batting-gambhir/,"September 16, 2021",Agency,Sports,"Mumbai: Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir believes West Indies batsman Chris Gayle has to open for his IPL team Punjab Kings during the second leg of IPL 2021. He also said it makes no sense to have the big-hitting Jamaican batting at three.
He has to open the batting. If Chris Gayle is in your team, then why would you want him to bat at number three. It makes no sense for anyone to put Chris Gayle at number three. West Indies did that, Punjab Kings did that. I have no clue why someone would do that, said Gambhir on Star Sports.
If Chris is in your playing 11, he has to open the batting because he is not going to waste balls. Probably at number three, he will have to run for a lot of singles, as compared to opening the batting. He could probably get you off to a flyer, added Gambhir.
The 39-year-old felt that Chennai Super Kings skipper MS Dhoni will find it difficult to score runs quickly when coming out to bat, especially after retiring from international cricket.
MS was a player who would’ve actually batted at number 4 or 5 but we’ve seen in the first leg that he normally bats at number 6 or 7. There are times when he’s actually pushed Sam Curran before him as well. The reason behind this is that he’s probably trying to be a mentor and a wicketkeeper, who can lead the side and keep wickets.
If the situation comes to a point where he probably has to play 8 or 10 balls, he can just go out there and whack them.
It’s going to be difficult for him, because once you are not playing international cricket; IPL is a very difficult tournament, it’s not like CPL and other leagues. IPL is where you face top-quality bowlers. For me, I think the biggest challenge for CSK will be that the top order needs to fire because that’s not the case anymore, added Gambhir."

The 66-year-old, who was part of the commentary panel of Sky Sports for over 20 years, had been contemplating hanging up the microphone for the last one year.
The former West Indian pacer, who was part of the Test series between India and England, had earlier said that he won’t be able to travel and be on the road like he used to at his age anymore.
I am not too sure how much further than 2020 I will be going with commentary. I cannot see myself going much further down the road at my age. I am 66 years old now, I am not 36, 46 or 56, Holding, who started doing cricket commentary in 1991 in the Caribbean, had said on a radio talk show.
I told (Sky) that I could not commit to more than a year at a time. If this year gets totally destroyed, I might have to think about 2021 because I can”t just walk away from Sky, a company that has done so much good for me.
Holding, who bid adieu to international cricket in 1987, was widely respected for his famous insightful analysis. His view on racism in sport and society in the aftermath of African-American George Floyd”s murder by a white policeman, had been a talking point last year.
Dubbed ‘Whispering Death’ during his playing days, Holding has played 60 Tests and 102 ODIs, taking 391 international wickets during his career.

Mumbai Indians will have an advantage in UAE: Gambhir,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/14/mumbai-indians-will-have-an-advantage-in-uae-gambhir/,"September 14, 2021",Agency,Sports,"Gautam Gambhir
Dubai: Defending champions Mumbai Indians will have an advantage playing in the UAE when the second phase of the IPL 2021 begins from September 19, said former Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir.
He believes that the conditions in the UAE will suit Mumbai Indians’ pacers. They’ve played in conditions that are completely different to where they normally play in. When you see the conditions in Chepauk or Delhi, they are completely different from what you get at Wankhede. And, as I mentioned, they are going into conditions that are suited to their fast bowling — people like Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult, Gambhir said on Star Sports’ show Game Plan.
There will be swing upfront, so they will be very dangerous. Plus, Mumbai wants balls to swing and you’ve got quality fast bowlers and it’s going to be an advantage for them. Plus their batters, want the balls to come on to the bat as well, people like Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, all those guys struggled at Chepauk, because it was gripping and turning.
They are not going to struggle, once they start playing in Dubai or Abu Dhabi. So, that’s the reason why I would feel Mumbai Indians will have an advantage; they can’t afford slow starter anymore, because they have seven games to go and they might have to win 5 matches to qualify, so they can’t afford to be in that situation, where they have to win five out of five, he added.
Mumbai Indians will kick start IPL 2021 with three-time champions Chennai Super Kings at the Dubai International Stadium on September 19.

US keen to unite families separated under Trump,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/14/us-keen-to-unite-families-separated-under-trump/,"September 14, 2021",Agency,Sports,"Joe Biden
Washington: The Biden administration is expanding its effort to find and reunite migrant families who were separated at the US-Mexico border under President Donald Trump as part of a zero-tolerance policy on illegal crossings.
A federal task force is launching a new program Monday that officials say will expand efforts to find parents, many of whom are in remote Central American communities, and help them return to the United States, where they will get at least three years of legal residency and other assistance. “We recognize that we can’t make these families completely whole again,” said Michelle Brané, executive director of the administration’s Family Reunification Task Force.
‘But we want to do everything we can to put them on a path towards a better life.’ The new program, which includes a contract with the International Organization for Migration to help with the often-complex task of getting expelled migrants back to the US, is a reflection of just how difficult it has been for President Joe Biden’s administration to address a chapter in US immigration history that drew widespread condemnation.
The task force has reunited about 50 families since starting its work in late February, but there are hundreds of parents, and perhaps between 1,000 and 2,000, who were separated from their children and have not been located. A lack of accurate records from the Trump administration makes it difficult to say for certain, Brané said.
It is a huge challenge that we are absolutely committed to following through to meet and to do whatever we can to reunify these families,’ she said as she outlined the new program in an interview with The Associated Press. The Trump administration separated thousands of migrant parents from their children in 2017 and 2018 as it moved to criminally prosecute people for illegally crossing the southwest border. Minors, who could not be held in criminal custody with their parents, were transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. They were then typically sent to live with a sponsor, often a relative or someone else with a connection to the family.
Amid widespread outrage, Trump issued an executive order halting the practice of family separations in June 2018, days before a federal judge did the same and demanded that separated families be reunited in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.
More than 5,500 children were separated from their families, according to the ACLU. The task force came up with an initial estimate closer to 4,000 but has been examining hundreds of other cases. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas held a virtual call with reunited families last month. ‘He made it very clear that an apology is not enough, that we really need to do a lot more for them and we recognize that,’ Brané said.
The new program includes a web portal that will allow parents to contact the US government to begin the process of reunification. The site and an outreach campaign to promote it will be in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and several indigenous languages of Central America.
Most of the parents are believed to be in Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Brazil. They often lack passports and the means to travel to their own country’s capital, let alone return to the US to try to gain entry at the border.
Once parents who were separated from their children are located, the US will work with the International Organization for Migration to help people get passports and other documents and return to the United States, where they will get work permits, residency for three years, and some support services.
Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s immigrant rights project, welcomed the Biden administration’s expanded efforts as an important first step,’ though he believes migrants should get more than three years of residency. ‘Ultimately, we need the families to be given permanent legal status in light of what the United States government deliberately did to these families,’ Gelernt said. The ACLU is in talks with the government to provide some compensation to the families as part of settlement talks.
Brané said the administration recognizes that ‘we need to find a better, longer-term solution to provide families with stability,’ but that it will take more time, and perhaps action from Congress, to achieve that goal. The contract with the IOM, an inter-governmental organization, and the expanded effort to find migrant parents and help them reach the US are initially planned to run for a year but could be extended if necessary.
We’ll continue looking for people until we feel that we’ve exhausted the options,’ she said.

Mumbai: Former Indian wicketkeeper-batsman  Farokh Engineer expressed his delight on former Indian captain MS Dhoni’s appointment as a mentor for the Indian team for the men’s T20 World Cup in the UAE and Oman. He also said that Dhoni’s experience and coolness will be a great inspiration for the team.
I am delighted MS Dhoni has been appointed as a mentor. Now, what does that mean, mentor, like a coach? Ravi Shastri is the coach and Dhoni is the mentor. Bit nice to have Dhoni alongside the team because of his experience and coolness and all that will certainly be a great inspiration for the team. I am delighted BCCI have taken that decision, said Engineer in an interview to Sports Tak.
Engineer was hopeful of Dhoni being a very good mentor for the Indian team in the mega event. ‘Mentor’s role, Dhoni, I think he is not the type to interfere with anybody. He is a cool customer. If he sees something is wrong or could be done better, I am sure he will suggest in a very clever way to Ravi or Virat. In all, I think we got a very good squad, a very good mentor, manager, and captain. So, I can’t see any team beating India in the T20 World Cup. I think India should win.’
Engineer felt that is it lovely to have former players serve as mentors and cited the example of Sachin Tendulkar’s association with Mumbai Indians in the IPL. ‘IPL has mentors. Every team has. What does a mentor do? It is an honorary thing, a thing of respect. Sachin Tendulkar is a mentor for Mumbai Indians. It’s a lovely thing to have figureheads like Sachin and Dhoni around.’

Gidney admitted that the situation was not in their control and promised a full refund to the ticket holders.
Meanwhile, a gutted England and Wales Cricket Board CEO Tom Harrison on Friday said that it was the Indian players’ anxiety over what might happen and not the COVID-19 outbreak itself that caused the cancellation of the fifth Test here even though all efforts were made to comfort the visitor.
Harrison said that the developments over the past few days have been devastating and added that everything necessary was done to convince the Indian players, who refused to take the field.
Harrison added that medical people who understand the virus were brought in to talk to the players on Thursday but they were clear about not playing the match. Once you have got the sense of anxiety in the dressing room, it would be very difficult to reverse that. Physical and mental health of players are important, he said.

The 23-year-old Army man, who won India’s maiden Olympic medal in athletics — a gold in Tokyo, said nobody should use his name to rake up any controversy.
I would request everyone to please not use me and my comments as a medium to further your vested interest and propaganda, Chopra, who became only the second Indian to win an individual Olympic gold, said on his Twitter handle.
Sports teaches us to be together and united. I’m extremely disappointed to see some of the reactions from the public on my recent comments.
There was nothing wrong with Arshad Nadeem using my javelin to prepare, it is within rules, and please do not use my name to push a dirty agenda, he added.
Chopra, in a recent interview, stated that he was searching for his personal javelin before his first throw during the Olympic final on August 7 and found Nadeem holding it.
According to rules, any javelin submitted to the officials by a competitor for his use can also be used by any other participant. This rule applies in all field events except for pole vault.
Chopra, who had used Valhalla version of Nordic brand during the final, made it clear that Nadeem, who had finished fifth, had not done anything wrong.
A controversy (mudda) has come up that I had talked about taking the javelin from Pakistani participant Arshad Nadeem before my first throw in the final (on August 7). It has been made into a big controversy, Chopra said in a video clip posted along with his tweet.
It’s is a very simple thing, we keep our personal javelin (inside a holding rack) but it can be used by anybody. It is the rule and there is nothing wrong in that. He (Nadeem) was having the javelin and preparing for his throw. I asked him to give it to me for my throw.
I am very sad that a big controversy has been created taking my name. We javelin throwers share a good bond and speak to each other nicely.
A former coach echoed Chopra’s view.
There is no controversy. It is not that you brought your personal javelin and nobody can use it. When you submitted it, others can also use it. Any participant can use any javelin which is there (in the holding rack), he asked."

Thailand strives to elevate Covid-hit tourism industry,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/08/24/thailand-strives-to-elevate-covid-hit-tourism-industry/,"August 24, 2021",Agency,Sports,"Bangkok: More than a year and a half since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, Thailand’s tourism industry is now struggling to survive and trying to shift from mass tourism to attracting more quality visitors.
The country received some 40 million international visitors in 2019, and the number came down to only 6.7 million in 2020.
For 2021, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) predicted that even in the best-case scenario, there will only be around 1-2 million foreign tourists visiting the country.
Some believed that this figure is still considered too optimistic given the current vaccination rate and rising number of daily cases in the country.
Focusing on high-end tourism has always been an ambitious target for Thailand. The authorities now believe that Thailand must use the pandemic as the catalyst to overhaul the industry, as this is the only way that the sector can survive and navigate through the crisis.
The government’s tourism-revival strategy is to target big spenders that are seeking for privacy and social distancing during their stays, especially during and post Covid-19 world, Tourism Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said, adding that the sector will try to attract high-end travellers, rather than a large number of visitors like what we have been relying on in the past.
Phiphat said quality travel will also help address problems that already existed before the pandemic, such as over-crowding at beaches and temples and other environmental impacts. It is vital that Thailand resets its entire tourism system, he said.
Several industry experts and operators have also attempted to promote more specific tourism segmentations such as medical and wellness, sports and food, or ultra-luxury travel.
On July 1, Thailand’s resort island of Phuket launched a sandbox scheme allowing vaccinated foreign tourists from low-and-medium-risk countries to visit the island without undergoing a two-week quarantine.
Earlier this month, the long-awaited Phuket sandbox 7+7 extension plan was approved by the Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA).
The program cuts the mandatory stay in Phuket from 14 days to seven days before the visitors are allowed to travel on to other designated destinations such as Koh Samui, Koh Phi Phi, and Krabi.
The Phuket sandbox and other pilot schemes are designed to be a long-term project, building up towards the peak season from December to March.
Many tourism-dependent localities elsewhere in the world stand to benefit from the achievement of Thailand’s reopening projects.
Yet two key important factors that will determine the pace of tourism recovery in Thailand are the effectiveness of the vaccine rollout in the country and the ability to control the spread of the virus, especially the more transmissible Delta variant, analysts said.
These major factors are crucial in Thailand’s plan to fully reopen for vaccinated tourists by mid-October, which very much will define the survival of its hospitality industry.

Hailing from Vadakara in Kozhikode district in Kerala, Nambiar, who started his career with the Air Force, took over Usha when she was very young and helped her achieve some of her greatest performances including the fourth-place finish in 400m hurdles at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.
Usha was one of the first to pay tributes to Nambiar.
The passing of my guru, my coach, my guiding light is going to leave a void that can never be filled. Words cannot express his contribution to my life. Anguished by the grief. Will miss you OM Nambiar sir. RIP, she tweeted along with a collage of her photographs with her coach.
Nambiar, an athlete who could not make it big at the national and international circuit, took to coaching early in his life and discovered a gem in Usha, who turned out to be the greatest athlete the country has ever produced.
It was Nambiar, who advised Usha to take up 400m hurdles a few months before the 1984 Olympics as he thought she had a good chance of winning an Olympic medal. His vision and dream nearly came true as Usha missed a bronze medal by a whisker.
Nambiar did his service with the Indian Air Force for 15 years and retired as a Sergeant in 1970.
He earned a coaching diploma from NIS-Patiala in 1968 and joined the Kerala Sports Council in 1971. He had a big role in identifying and nurturing several medal-winning athletes including Shiny Wilson and Vandana Rao.
He was awarded the Padma Shri earlier this year.

It truly was fantastic to watch and captured the imagination of the world and we would love for cricket to be a part of future Games.

Anti-Asian hate crimes bill sent to Biden for signature,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/05/19/anti-asian-hate-crimes-bill-sent-to-biden-for-signature/,"May 19, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"Joe Biden
New York: The US House on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to pass a bill aimed at combating the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in the country, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden’s desk for signature.
The Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act passed in a 364-62 vote in the House, with all no votes coming from Republicans. The Senate last month approved the bill on a 94-1 vote, with GOP Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri casting the lone no vote, Xinhua reported. Biden is expected to sign the bill into law as soon as Thursday.
After a year of the Asian American community crying out for help, today Congress is taking historic action to pass long overdue hate crimes legislation and send the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act to President Biden’s desk, Judy Chu, Democratic congresswoman from California and chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, told reporters before the vote.
The past year and a half has been one of pain and struggle marked by despicable and sickening acts of hate and violence against the Asian-American community, Democratic Congresswoman Grace Meng, who coauthored the legislation with Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Those of Asian descent have been blamed and scapegoated for the outbreak of Covid-19 and as a result Asian Americans have been beaten, slashed, spat on and even set on fire and killed, Meng said.
The legislation would create a position at the Justice Department to expedite a review of Covid-19-related hate crimes; provide grants for states to create hotlines for reporting hate crimes and for law enforcement training aimed at preventing and identifying hate crimes; and direct federal agencies to work with community organizations to help raise awareness about hate crimes during the pandemic.
The Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act will strengthen our defenses to prevent and combat anti-AAPI violence and will build on steps already taken by President Biden. Together these actions will make a significant difference in how we address hate crimes in America, not only during this pandemic, but for years to come, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday.
Reported hate crimes against Asian Americans in 16 of the nation’s largest cities and counties have increased 164 percent since last year, showed a recent study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University San Bernardino.
Separately, Stop AAPI Hate, a center tracking reports of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans, said it has received 6,603 firsthand complaints — nearly two-thirds of them reported by women — since last year, revealing the troubling spike in anti-Asian hatred during the pandemic while underscoring the need for urgent actions, including those from Congress.

ICC investigates alleged crimes in Palestinian territories,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/03/04/icc-investigates-alleged-crimes-in-palestinian-territories/,"March 4, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"The Hague: The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Wednesday she has launched an investigation into alleged crimes in the Palestinian territories, plunging the court into the midst of one of the most fraught conflicts of the past half century.
Fatou Bensouda said in a statement the probe will be conducted independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour.
Bensouda said in 2019 there was a reasonable basis to open a war crimes probe into Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip as well as Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.
Following that assessment, she asked judges to rule on the extent of the court’s jurisdiction in the troubled region. They did that last month, saying that the court’s jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
There was no immediate reaction from Israel. The Palestinians joined the court in 2015 and have long pushed for an investigation of Israel, which is not a member of the court. The Palestinians asked the court to probe Israeli actions during its 2014 war against Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel’s construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem.
In the past, Israeli officials have accused the court of overstepping its bounds, saying the Palestinians are not an independent sovereign state. Officials say that Israel has been unfairly singled out and reject the allegations. They say military actions in Gaza were acts of self-defense and the status of the West Bank is disputed and must be resolved through negotiations.
The investigation will likely also look into alleged crimes by Palestinian militants. Bensouda has said her probe would look into the actions of Hamas, which fired rockets indiscriminately into Israel during the 2014 war.
Bensouda said how prosecutors prioritise their work will be determined in due time based on constraints including the coronavirus pandemic, limited resources and their existing heavy workload.
Such challenges, however, as daunting and complex as they are, cannot divert us from ultimately discharging the responsibilities that the Rome Statute places upon the Office, she said, referring to the court’s founding treaty.

He said that jail time for dowry deaths would be increased from seven to 10 years; using criminal force to ‘disrobe’ women (354B) would attract five to seven years’ jail-term instead of three; repeated offenses such as stalking (354D) would attract a maximum punishment of seven years instead of five.
Trafficking of minors for sex trade by selling them (Sec 372) or buying them (Sec 373) would attract punishment ranging between seven years and life term.

“As per statistics, UP is on the top in many crimes in the entire country. Again a brutal murder case came up in Jaunpur today. Enough is enough. Who is accountable?” she added.

Streaming platforms leading to crimes?,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/06/22/streaming-platforms-leading-to-crimes/,"June 22, 2020",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: Ever since the entry of OTT platforms, there has been a complaint that uncensored content streamed by them are leading to adverse things in the society.
With the Covid-19 induced lockdown increasing the demand for OTT platforms, the allegation became more vocal. Recently, a web-series was withdrawn after protests.
And now, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, making a case for imposing censorship on content available on streaming platforms, insisting that criminal activities are on the rise due to obscene and violent depictions in shows.
He said incidents of crime are increasing against women and children because of the “negative impact’ on the minds of people due to their exposure to such programmes. There is no clarity in the rules regarding streaming services,” he said.
The availability of inappropriate content without any censorship is unacceptable, Kumar said, urging the Prime Minister to take necessary steps to bring programmes broadcast through streaming platforms within the ambit of certification under the Cinematograph Act, 1952.
Besides, the production and broadcast of such programmes having obscene and violent content should be brought under the purview of crime so that people concerned can be punished, Kumar said.
He said that several streaming service players are “uninterruptedly broadcasting shows having violence and sex” in the absence of censorship.
In December last year, Kumar had written to Modi, demanding a ban on pornographic sites.
Says Santha, a women’s rights activist, “many of these shows portray women as an object of sex and lust. More than censorship, self-censorship is the need of the hour”.
A top official with a leading entertainment company says, “sex and crimes get us more views. So we are focusing more on such content. At the same time, we are cautious too. We know our responsibilities”.

International Criminal Court to probe war crimes in Palestine,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/12/21/international-criminal-court-to-probe-war-crimes-in-palestine/,"December 21, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"The photo file of ICC war crimes
THE HAGUE: The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor has said she wanted to open a full investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories, sparking a furious reaction from Israel and condemnation from the United States.
The Palestinians welcomed the move by the ICC as a “long overdue step” following a nearly five-year preliminary probe by the prosecutor into the situation since the 2014 war in Gaza.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision made the Hague-based court, which Israel has refused to sign up to since its creation in 2002, a “political tool” against the Jewish state.
“I am satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation into the situation in Palestine,” ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement.
“In brief, I am satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,” she added, without specifying the perpetrators of the alleged crimes.
She said that before opening a full probe, she would ask the ICC to rule on the territory over which it has jurisdiction because of the “unique and highly contested legal and factual issues attaching to this situation.”
“Specifically, I have sought confirmation that the “territory” over which the Court may exercise its jurisdiction, and which I may subject to investigation, comprises the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza.
” The prosecutor added however that she did not require any authorisation from judges to open a probe as there had been a referral from the Palestinians, who joined the court in 2015.
“We firmly oppose this and any other action that seeks to target Israel unfairly,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said of Washington’s top ally in the region.
“We do not believe the Palestinians qualify as a sovereign state, and they therefore are not qualified to obtain full membership, or participate as a state in international organizations, entities, or conferences, including the ICC.
The issue is highly sensitive, with former White House national security adviser John Bolton threatening last year to arrest ICC judges if they moved against Israel or the United States. Both countries have refused to sign up to the court, which was set up in 2002 to be the only global tribunal trying the world”s worst crimes, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Bensouda launched a preliminary probe in January 2015 into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel and the Palestinian territories, in the wake of the 2014 Gaza war. A full ICC investigation could possibly lead to charges against individuals. States cannot be charged by the ICC.
“Palestine welcomes this step as a long overdue step to move the process forward towards an investigation, after nearly five long and difficult years of preliminary examination,” the Palestinian statement said.
Netanyahu however lashed out at what he called a “dark day for truth and justice”. “The ICC prosecutor’s decision has turned the International Criminal Court into a political tool to delegitimise the State of Israel,” he said.
The ICC’s preliminary investigation has looked at the 2014 war which left 2,251 dead on the Palestinian side, the majority civilians, and 74 on the Israeli side, most of them soldiers. It has also looked at violence near the Israel-Gaza border in 2018.
Earlier this month, the ICC prosecutor refused to press charges over a deadly 2010 Israeli raid on a flotilla bringing aid to Gaza, and urged that probe to be shut.
Nine Turkish citizens died in May 2010 when Israeli marines stormed the Mavi Marmara, among eight ships trying to break a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. One more died in hospital in 2014."

Rani is reprising the role of the fearless and committed Superintendent of Police, Shivani Shivaji Roy. She had delivered a knock-out performance in this hugely acclaimed prequel, Mardaani, in which she took on the kingpin of a child trafficking racket. Audiences are expecting no less from Rani especially after the trailer of the film in which she is seen taking on a villain who systematically targets women.
“Two years back, a violent crime rocked the nation and it happened on the Yamuna Expressway where four women were raped. They simply used a vehicle to carry out these crimes. If you see Mardaani 2 trailer, the villain clearly uses a car to pick up unsuspecting women and then carries out his plan. This incident and the nature of the cold-blooded, non-repenting criminals was the inspiration behind Mardaani 2,” says a source close to the project.
Director Gopi Puthran said, “Ideas for films like Mardaani 2 tend to come from some real life inspirations because the horrific nature of crimes that you read about in papers, do shock you and stay with you. My film is inspired from various such incidents that happened across the country. Mardaani 2 focusses on such crimes committed by juveniles, how they are on the rise across the nation and we need to pay heed to this.” Produced by Aditya Chopra, Mardaani 2 is set to hit theatres on 13 December."

In this article, News Today compiles a list of major white-collar crimes that rocked our country.
Shady lendings – PMC Bank
Customers of PMC were in for a shock when they received a message stating it has been put under directions by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for six months. Then media reports emerged that PMC Bank had granted a loan of Rs 96.5 crore to debt-laden realty company Housing Development and Infrastructure’s (HDIL) promoter Sarang Wadhawan, whose company had already defaulted on a Rs 2,500-crore loan given by lender.
HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan (R) and his son Sarang Wadhawan (L)
Ignoring rules, PMC Bank sanctioned the personal loan in August and it was over and above the Rs 2,500-crore loan that HDIL had ceased repaying, and which the bank failed to classify as bad loans. PMC Bank kept dealing with HDIL even when it was facing insolvency proceedings in National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
Earlier, news reports mentioned that just one account – HDIL – was the single reason for the PMC Bank’s woes, which was subsequently acknowledged by PMC’s managing director, Joy Thomas. Wadhawan and HDIL took loans from PMC Bank to clear Bank of India’s (BoI’s) dues, which had initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the company for allegedly defaulting on loans of around Rs 520 crore. As per latest reports, HDIL owner Rakesh Wadhawan was arrested by Mumbai Police.
Quid pro quo – ICICI Bank & Videocon
Chanda Kochhar
In October 2016, ICICI Bank-Videocon scam cames into spotlight after a whistleblower Arvind Gupta, an investor in both, raised concerns through a blog. Gupta alleged that Chanda Kochhar influenced a Rs 3,250-crore loan to Venugopal Dhoot-led Videocon group in 2012 in return for a deal in NuPower Renewables and Supreme Energy, a clean-energy firm run by her husband Deepak Kochhar.
Gupta wrote to Prime Minister, RBI Governor and other authorities demanding a probe but it gathered no attention, reported ET. Gupta alleged that a company owned by Dhoot loaned Rs 64 crore in March 2010 to NuPower Renewables that he and Deepak Kochhar had jointly promoted two years ago. A complex web of deals resulted in a trust controlled by Deepak Kochhar acquiring the lending company six months after Videocon Group received loan from ICICI. The transfer of company shares to Kochhar’s trust was made at Rs 9 lakh. A company that loaned an amount of Rs 64 crore was acquired by the trust Deepak Kochhar controlled for just Rs 9 lakh which naturally raised eyebrows.
Dhoot also sold his 50 per cent stake in NuPower Renewables for Rs 2.5 lakh to Deepak Kochhar. Gupta alleged that ICICI awarding loan to Videocon and loan later becoming an NPA in 2017 were due to Dhoot’s business relations with Deepak Kochhar whose wife, Chanda, was part of the commiittee that sanctioned the loan. Moneycontrol said, nearly 86 per cent of Videocon’s ICICI Bank loan remains unpaid.
Diamond fraudster – Nirav Modi
Nirav Modi
On January 2018, associates of Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamonds approached Punjab National Bank (PNB) with a request for LoUs to make payment to its overseas suppliers. The bank demanded a 100 percent cash margin for issuing LoUs but the firms informed they had received LoUs without any such guarantee previously. Branch records didn’t show any such facility having been granted to the firms as PNB suspected fraud and began digging into transaction history.
PNB then filed a complaint with CBI. It was alleged that Nirav, Ami Modi, Nishal Modi and Mehul Choksi (partners of M/s Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamonds) in collusion with two bank officials cheated PNB. The two PNB official issued fraudulent LoUs to Hong Kong-based creditors on behalf of three firms associated with Nirav Modi and Gitanjali Group. By May 2018, the scam rose to Rs 14,356.84 crore. Latest reports say Nirav was remanded in judicial custody until 17 October by UK court.

Several of his firms including Kingfisher Airlines stumbled with losses.

On 14 April, as we welcomed the Tamil New Year, a brutal crime shook a quaint neighbourhood of Besant Nagar near Elliot’s Beach.
An UK-educated man, whose late father was a Member of Parliament, had allegedly stabbed his mother to death, as she refused to sell the family property. The murder took place at their sea-facing residence in Sixth Avenue, with the heart-wrenching part being the accused’s doctor sister hearing the entire violence unfold over the phone.
In yet another case, a techie was stabbed by her ex-boyfriend with a pen knife in Thiruvanmiyur. The distraught man later attempted suicide by slitting his wrist.
The victim, a 22-year-old software engineer, was a native of Ambur, and was living in an apartment here. As per reports, she was in a relationship with a 23-year-old man for three years and had attended the same engineering college in Kanchipuram. The woman eventually decided to end the affair, as her boyfriend could not land a job anywhere, and hence broke up over the phone.
However, what she faced was threats of dire consequences. Earlier this week, during a meeting, he pulled out a pen knife and stabbed her multiple times on her neck, hands, stomach. He was subsequently caught by the public and handed over to the police.
The area of Pallikaranai saw the arrest of two youths, including an engineering student, for shooting an obscene video of a 17-year-old girl and threatening to post it on social media.
Police said, the girl who was a first-year engineering student, was dating her collegemate of Pallikaranai. One day, on the pretext of discussing marriage, he lured her home, where the video was shot with the help of his friend, who was hiding in the store room.
The victim told the police that post the incident, the boy had been indifferent towards her and demanded money. When she confronted, he showed the video and threatened to post it online.
She is then said to have disclosed the matter to her family, who helped her lodge a complaint.
Police claim that in most cases such as murder and stalking, the accused is a known person to the victims, hence controlling those crimes becomes more challenging. “But we have taken a serious note of the recent incidents and will increase vigil. Already, installation of CCTV cameras has brought down crimes,” a higher official said."

Year after year, women get no respite from brutal cases of stalking and murder.
A few weeks ago, the murder of a young teacher killed inside a classroom by a spurned lover in Cuddalore shocked everyone.
In yet another case, a woman, Sandhya, was murdered by her husband and dismembered and her body parts were scattered at Pallikaranai dumpyard and maybe elsewhere. Her husband S R Balakrishnan killed her on suspecting her fidelity, even as the couple had filed for divorce.
If one thinks that only young women are subjected to sexual assault, think again.
A few days ago, three young men, aged 17, gangraped an elderly woman in her house in MKB Nagar. Last year, a 11-year-old speech and hearing impaired girl in Ayanavaram, was sexually abused by 17 men who worked in her building. According to police sources, crimes against women are mostly carried out by people known to them.
A police source said, “Stalking, eve-teasing, murder, cyber-related crimes, domestic violence and dowry harassment are some of the violations faced by women. In most crime cases against women, the offenders are known to the victims – be it stalking or murder.”
In most cases, this is also a reason why police claim they cannot prevent it."

JK Rowling’s imagination continues to run wild and the visual effects are just dazzling. But even hardcore HP fans can’t deny the irregular flow of the film and the several complicated subplots which might cause a wee bit of confusion. Despite this, there are still major twists that will baffle the audience.
The film begins with the escape of the evil wizard, Gellert Grindelwald – portrayed by Johnny Depp – from the clutches of the Ministry of Wizards of the Unites States. Credence, the troubled young boy with uncontrollable power played by Ezra Miller is in Paris, figuring out who he is with the help of Nagini (Claudia Kim). Grindelwald plans to use Credence for his own power hungry ambitions; to rule both the wizard and muggle (non-wizard) world.
But Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is recruited by young Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) to find and help Credence before its too late. Newt is joined by Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) and the loveable muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) who is trying to win back his love, Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol).
As the movie progresses, a myriad of events takes place leaving the wizarding world in mayhem as Grindelwald wrecks havoc. Jude Law and Johnny Depp’s performances are tailored with perfection. Johnny Depp’s speech when his character gathers his followers was nailed with flamboyancy.
From the beasts design to the final sequence involving an intense battle between Grindelwald and the good wizards is sure to leave the audience in awe, thanks to the vibrant VFX and the production design. The costume design is sure to grab an Oscar nomination and why not? Didn’t Colleen Atwood – the costume designer -help win the very first Oscar for the HP universe?
Die hard Harry Potter fans can’t miss the deja vu references from the HP series like when the legendary alchemist, Nicholas Flamel opens his cupboard to read a book or when Dumbledore teaches his class how to deal with a boggart. Such scenes sure to leave them in nostalgia. Yet, there’s no denying that the story is burdened with too many subplots. Hopefully, the unanswered questions will be answered in the next films. Nonetheless, this movie is sure to entertain."

He also mentioned that the Mylapore police have finished installing fifty percent of cameras. Velmurugan added that deploying police officers to every streets in the locality will be difficult due to shortage of man power but installation of the cameras will instead act as a third eye for them. “These cameras will create a sense of fear among the offenders and that in itself reduces the chances of crime happening here,” he said.
The police are also conducting campaigns and drives to create awareness among the residents to put up CCTVs in their home. “They have welcomed the move with open arms and are consistently supporting us,” said Velmurugan. “Several residents have also taken the initiative to instal cameras at places close to their homes.”
He added that as fifty percent of the cameras have already been installed around the area, the rate of crimes have dropped down.
“Reports of theft from residents have come down,”said Velmurugan. “Once we install them completely, the number of crime will reduce further.”
Some of the places that have come under the CCTV scanner includes the Luz corner junction. “This junction has several building around it and we have installed cameras to monitor the crowd,” said Velumuragn. “Places like this have high traffic and people move here a lot. We have started by covering such spots and then install cameras at residential streets and lanes of the locality.”"

SCARY RIDE
Auto Shankar
‘Auto’ Shankar
Nobody can forget the tall, scrawny man with thick mops of curly hair smiling for a photograph from behind bars.

However, with his nefarious activtives, he became a fearful figure, an uncrowned king of unlawful activities.
He ran prostitution dens from a line of huts in Periyar Nagar as well as from a lodge on L B Road with the connivance of the police. He committed six murders in two years for which he was eventually convicted.
Gowrishankar was hanged at Salem prison along with his associates Eldin and Shivaji in 1995.
KNIFE DEFEATS PEN
Lakshmikanthan
M K Thyagaraja Bhagavathar
Movies often depict cinema journalists pitched against actors and directors. There is a popular case in real life too. One that turned bloody.
C N Lakshmikanthan was a famous film journalist in Madras Presidency. In 1943, he launched a film weekly called ‘Cinema Thoothu,’ which was extremely successful.
He wrote extensive columns devoted to the personal lives of some of the top actors and actresses. However, he locked horns with actors M K Thyagaraja Bhagavathar and N S Krishnan and film director Sreeramulu Naidu.
On 8 November 1944, Lakshmikanthan was attacked by a group of assailants at Vepery and one of them stabbed him. Although he was bleeding, he managed to walk to his friend’s house, who listened to his description of the incident.
His friend sent him to General Hospital. On the way, Lakshmikanthan stopped at Vepery police Station to file a complaint against the assailants. He passed away at the General Hospital.
The actors and director served prison terms, and that was the end of their career.
BIG DADA
Veeramani
Ayodhyakuppam Veeramani
If at all there was a name which was feared by the public and police in Chennai, it was Ayodhyakuppam Veeramani.
He was a fisherman-turned-gangster who controlled the sea belt and spirit trades. It is said Veeramani would send a hit squad to kill anybody for money. He appeared in public in fancy cars, with plenty of jewellery.
An accused in 35 cases, including five murders and 11 attempt to murder cases, he was once sentenced to death, which was later reduced to seven years imprisonment.
He was called the ‘dada’ of Chennai coastline and managed to escape from the police for a couple of years, restricting his activities to Cuddalore.
There were cases of abduction, narcotics trade, assault and extortion against him. He was detained under the Goondas Act five times.
He was shot at by two sub-inspectors of police, in an ‘encounter’ in broad daylight at the Marina beach in 2003.
When news of his death spread, tension was palpable in the city. Many shops downed shutters and police was prepared for a law and order situation arising out of it.
HORRIFIC KILLER
Dashvanth case
S Dashvanth
In 2017, the city came face to face with a monster: S Dashvanth, a 22-year-old techie was arrested for brutally raping and murdering a seven-year-old girl in Mugalivakkam February 2017.
The girl, who was his neighbour, was lured into his apartment and assaulted and gagged. Her body was burnt beyond recognition and dumped.
When he came out on bail in December, he murdered his mother and stole valuables from his house.
He confessed in court that he planned to kill his father also. In February 2018, the court awarded him death sentence."
Trump’s former aides face prison for multiple financial crimes,https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/22/trumps-former-aides-face-prison-for-multiple-financial-crimes/,"August 22, 2018",PTI,Crimes,"Michael Cohen
New York: Donald Trump has suffered a double blow after his former campaign chief Paul Manafort was found guilty of fraud, and his ex lawyer Michael Cohen admitted to paying hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 US election, potentially leaving the US President in legal jeopardy.
In a stunning admission that implicates Trump, his former lawyer Cohen pleaded guilty to buying the silence of two women about their alleged affairs with Trump.
Cohen, 51, pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to charges of tax evasion, making false statements to a federally insured bank and campaign finance violations.
The most-stunning admission he made in court before US District Judge William Pauley was that in 2016, Cohen had made payments of USD 280,000 to silence two women, who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby “intending to influence the 2016 presidential election.”
The presidential candidate here is Trump and the payments were to adult film actress Daniels and a former Playboy playmate, a clear implication of the President.
Cohen’s sentencing is scheduled for 12 December. Cohen told the judge that the payments to the women were made “in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office” and “for the principal purpose of influencing the election” for president in 2016.
Trump has not been named by federal prosecutors in the charges against Cohen but has been identified as “Individual 1.”
Paul Manafort
The extraordinary admission came minutes after Trump’s former campaign chairman, 69-year-old Manafort, was convicted of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account.
The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining 10 counts, and the judge declared a mistrial on those charges.
The two cases arose from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Yesterday’s events represent a significant victory for Mueller, who has been under pressure from Trump’s supporters to wind up what the President calls a “witch hunt.”
The Virginia trial of Manafort did not delve into the nature of Trump campaign contacts with Russia, which is the focus of the Mueller investigation. But the conviction of a figure as prominent as Manafort, who ran the Trump campaign for a crucial five-month period in 2016, was a blow to the White House and a boost for the special counsel.
Prosecutors presented evidence that Manafort had lied in seeking personal loans and lied to the Internal Revenue Service in reporting income related to his political consulting work in Ukraine and elsewhere.
The outcomes of the two cases also raised grave questions about Trump’s judgment. Since his election, his national security adviser, personal lawyer, campaign chairman, deputy campaign manager and a foreign policy aide have all admitted or been convicted of crimes.
With two former aides to the president facing jail time, observers said the outcome of the separate, high-profile prosecutions could represent a turning point in Trump’s presidency in which the months-long investigations into his former dealings begin to leave a mark.
As the legal developments unfolded, Trump boarded Air Force One for the trip to Charleston, West Virginia, part of an all-out political strategy to keep the House and Senate in Republican hands in the midterm elections this year.
The stakes for Trump are now legal as well as political. After landing in Charleston for the rally, the President said the Manafort verdict didn’t have anything to do with him.
“Paul Manafort is a good man,” Trump said. “It doesn’t involve me, but it’s a very sad thing.” Trump, speaking to reporters on the tarmac, declined to answer questions about Cohen.
Rudolph Giuliani, the President’s personal attorney, said there were no allegations of wrongdoing against the President in the Cohen case.
“It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Cohen’s actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time,” Giuliani said.
Prosecutors said Cohen held the title of “executive vice-president” and “special counsel” to the owner of the company, “Individual-1,” who apparently is Trump.
In January 2017, Cohen left the company and began holding himself out as the “personal attorney” to “Individual-1, who by that time had become the president of the United States.”
Democrats sought to pile political pressure on Donald Trump after the news broke, with the party’s leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, denouncing the “rampant corruption and criminality at the heart of Trump’s inner circle.”"
"Activists gather at Jantar Mantar, condemn rising hate crimes",https://newstodaynet.com/2018/08/10/activists-gather-at-jantar-mantar-condemn-rising-hate-crimes/,"August 10, 2018",PTI,Crimes,"New Delhi: A group of activists held a meet at the Jantar Mantar today, demanding justice for the victims of hate crimes.
They demanded immediate implementation of the 17 July Supreme Court directives to prevent vigilantism and compensation for victims of hate.
The activists also sought prosecution of political and public figures who through action or speech support vigilantism. Criticising the NDA government over the rising violence in the country, filmmaker Saba Dewan alleged minorities including Muslims and Dalits are being targeted.
“Union Minister Jayant Sinha was seen openly garlanding those convicted of lynching. It is shameful that we have a lynch map of India now,” she said.
Rahul Roy, the organiser of the gathering, urged the people to come out on the streets and raise their voice against such acts of violence. Representatives of the Socialist Party of India, National Alliance of People’s Movements and Khudai Khidmatgar began their three-day hunger strike against hate crimes.
Advocate Vrinda Grover lashed out at the government over the Hapur lynching case. “Fake FIRs were registered and the accused were let out on bail. Police and adminstration were trying to cover up the matter,” she alleged."
Decriminalising crimes,https://newstodaynet.com/2012/10/20/decriminalising-crimes/,"October 20, 2012",Jawahar T R,Crimes,"No one wants his/her pocket picked. Or property trespassed or grabbed. Nor, for that matter, would anyone look forward to getting murdered, assaulted, raped or in any way violated, physically, financially or emotionally, though the last one is tenuous territory. Being a victim of crime hurts in many ways and often leaves an inerasable mark, if not on the physique, at least on the psyche. Reason why legal luminaries hold that ‘a system of penal law is more important than even constitutional law’.
Really? Such assumptions seem passé in India with the very character of crime begging a relook. Of course, the history of criminology shows that the nature of crime has been changing with the times as also with the evolution of law. Old crimes have exited and new ones have entered the arc. But with our lawmakers topping the charts as law breakers, our country is now on the cusp of a momentous ‘Criminal Revolution’, warranting a complete overhaul of penal laws to suit the current crime climes. Some suggestions:
We will start from where we started: Pick Pocket. Frankly, I pity those who indulge in this rather risky vocation. And a very fruitless one these days, what with diminishing returns owing to purse owners switching from hard cash to harder plastic and ritzy hardware. Of course, if luck smiles one can still land a juicy wallet but that’s somewhat like fishing … all of patience and perseverance. And when caught, as happens if cops too have a dry day, our pathetic protagonist is punished disproportionately, thrashed around and trashed as social garbage, all for a few petty pennies.
But can all these penny ‘pinchers’ of the land collectively hold a candle to the suave politico who plunders the public pocket with such panache that none ever feels it? And what to say of the penny-wise-pound-foolish people who still hold the private pocket picker a greater personal peril? This when we have knowingly handed our treasury to the slick politico, while no such trust and courtesy are extended to the blade-runner scouting our backs! Legal equity and even-handedness demands that, since no politico is ever nabbed for stealing, a pickpocket too should never be apprehended. Ditto with petty thieves.
While on the subject of political thefts, let’s ponder over some problems. The scam-a-day diet has caused acute indigestion. Kejriwal and the media wallahs must know that overdose could kill the patient, meaning, citizens. Scams are fine, but a minimum gap between two scams must be stipulated in public interest. And no underdose of just a few lakhs or crores either. Even central ministers feel insulted. So, a CAG certification should be mandatory for any exposure. That is the only outfit that talks in a range that can enthuse and entertain people and ensure good TRP.
Leave the elusive Lokpal, even existing anti-corruption laws need a revamp. The Prevention of Corruption Act is useless. Forget lofty legalese, even elementary English says that a scam that has happened has actually escaped prevention and so a Prevention Act loses jurisdiction and cannot be invoked. Given that no scam is ever prevented, why such laws at all? And since, there is no retribution post corruption either, is it not wise to have an official rate card for sleaze befitting political stature? Plus a round robin routine so that corruption gets egalitarian? I also propose a reverse amnesty scheme to convert the people’s paltry white money into black and an agreement with the Swiss Government to send us at least chocolates if it is unwilling to part with our country’s cash.
Land grab was perfectly legit all through history. Only that it went under the names, ‘liberation’, ‘conquest’ ‘colonialism’ etc. But today an ordinary citizen cannot walk into a neighbour’s home or farm without being accused of trespassing. Outrageous. It’s God’s earth and anyone can tread anywhere one pleases, public or personal property no matter. Doubters can ask Rob, a very private citizen like you and me but a privileged one, unlike you and me. Now, if a son-in-law of a neo-coloniser can have such freedom of choice and movement across all he can survey, can’t the sons of the soil too turn the law unto themselves? What is Haryana and DLF for him can’t be never-never-land for us! So all property laws should be amended forthwith so that no land-grab suit ever sullies our sacred soil. Even the pious BJP would happily endorse such changes, given current trends.
Rape has to be de-criminalised right away. If some ruling politicos are right, most rapes are actually either consensual episodes or the victims’ fault. So, the wails of a woman or her flailing arms are to be deemed signs of acquiescence. And bad dressing in public is an invitation! Bharath ‘mata’ ki jai! Ha, how many rapists have been unfairly condemned for no crime! In Haryana, where men have been grabbing women with the same gusto as they grab land, food like noodles are blamed for turning good men into rapists. Now, how do you hang noodles, of all things? Rape should, therefore, be off our law books … if wolfish men are to remain ‘legally’ chaste!
Readers can make their own wish-lists. But finally I suggest deletion of the word ‘crime’ from legal as well as laymen’s lexicons. That seems the only way we can have a ‘crime-free’ society!

Editorial: Capitol letters,https://newstodaynet.com/2022/01/03/editorial-capitol-letters-2/,"January 3, 2022",NT Bureau,Crimes,"One year after the violent assault on the US Capitol, Americans remain deeply concerned about the health of their democracy and about a third say violence against the government can sometimes be justified, according to two polls published Sunday.
The 6 January attack on the seat of Congress, led by supporters of Donald Trump, was ‘a harbinger of increasing political violence,’ and American democracy ‘is threatened,’ according to two-thirds of those surveyed for a CBS News poll. Meanwhile, Americans’ ‘pride’ in their democracy has dropped sharply, from 90 percent in 2002 to 54 percent now, a Washington Post/University of Maryland survey found.
In the meantime, after six months of intense work, the House committee investigating the insurrection is preparing to go public. In the coming months, members of the panel will start to reveal their findings against the backdrop of the former president and his allies’ persistent efforts to whitewash the riots and reject suggestions that he helped instigate them.
The committee also faces the burden of trying to persuade the American public that their conclusions are fact-based and credible. But the nine lawmakers – seven Democrats and two Republicans – are united in their commitment to tell the full story of 6 January, and they are planning televised hearings and reports that will bring their findings out into the open.
The Justice Department’s investigation of the riot has now entered the punishment phase. So far, 71 people have been sentenced for riot-related crimes. They include a company CEO, an architect, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, a gym owner, a former Houston police officer and a University of Kentucky student.
Many rioters have said they lost jobs and friends after their mob of Donald Trump loyalists disrupted the certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. Fifty-six of the 71 pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. Most of them were sentenced to home confinement or jail terms measured in weeks or months, according to an Associated Press tally of every sentencing. But rioters who assaulted police officers have gotten years behind bars.

Editorial: From warfield to streets,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/06/editorial-from-warfield-to-streets/,"October 6, 2021",NT Bureau,Crimes,"One fighter after another, the Taliban are trading in their characteristic long flowing garb for stiff military uniforms. It is a symbol of the moment of transition they find themselves in: Once warriors embedded in Afghanistan’s rugged mountains, now they are an urban police force. But change is always an adjustment.
In the Afghan capital of Kabul, crime was rampant under the previous government of Ashraf Ghani. Robberies and kidnappings were a near daily occurrence and the judicial process time-consuming and expensive.
By winning the country after two decades of war with the Aug. 15 seizure of Kabul, the Taliban also inherited a city marked by lawlessness. Immediately they set to work, making their presence known in daily street patrols. Some have done away with the typical AK-47 rifles, for US-made M16s left behind by Afghan forces. They halt street fights, summon suspected criminals to police stations and chase those who do not heed their call.
In Kabul’s police district 8, there is a long queue leading to two rooms. In one, there are criminal cases. In another, civilian disputes. Victims of stabbings, robbery and other misdeeds sit in the same room as alleged perpetrators, staring into the distance until it’s their turn to plead their case.
For lesser crimes, Taliban police offer the accused three days to show up to the station. After that, they go after them. The court system is a work in progress, officials said. Meetings are still underway between Taliban officials used to tribal justice prevalent in rural Afghanistan to work out the process in a sprawling city with an active judiciary.
Even those who fear them in the embattled city welcome the peace their arrival has wrought. The Taliban have empowered local elders to pass judgement based on Shariah, or Islamic law, for minor criminal cases. In the Sheikh Zayed City residential area of Kabul, a committee of elders ordered the father of a man accused of stabbing a neighbor to pay 35,000 Afghanis, around 400. The father counts the banknotes in a rapid shuffle and hands it to the imam, who offers it to the family of the victim. They embrace. Justice served.

"Sex abuse probe: French church had 3,000 child abusers",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/04/sex-abuse-probe-french-church-had-3000-child-abusers/,"October 4, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"Paris: An independent commission examining church sex abuse in France believes that 3,000 child abusers two-thirds of them priests have worked in the church over the past 70 years.
The estimate was given by the commission president, Jean-Marc Sauvé, in an interview published Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper. The commission has been investigating for 2 1/2 years. Its full findings are scheduled to be released on Tuesday.
In the interview, Sauvé did not give a figure on the number of sex abuse victims but said the report does include a new estimate.
Asked about the commission’s work investigating child abusers, he said: We evaluated their number at 3,000, out of 115,00 priests and church people since the 1950s. Two-thirds are diocesan priests.’ He said 22 cases have been forwarded to prosecutors for alleged crimes that can still be pursued. More than 40 cases of alleged crimes that are too old to be prosecuted but that involve suspects who are still alive have been forwarded to church officials, Sauvé said.
From 1950 to 1970, the church is completely indifferent to the victims: They don’t exist, the suffering inflicted on children is ignored, the newspaper quoted him as saying. The periods that followed were different. He added: ‘Our objective is to furnish a concrete diagnosis of all the abuses, to identify the causes and draw all of the consequences.’

"London police lose trust after officer abducts, kills woman",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/10/02/london-police-lose-trust-after-officer-abducts-kills-woman/,"October 2, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"London: Police in Britain’s capital are desperately trying to regain the trust of women after revelations about how a serving officer used his position to abduct, rape and murder a young woman, taking the unprecedented step of advising women and girls how to protect themselves during interactions with police.
The Metropolitan Police Service issued the information Thursday night after evidence presented during the sentencing of Wayne Couzens showed that he used his police identification to stop 33-year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard in south London, then handcuffed her, threw her in the back of a car and drove her to a remote location where he raped and strangled her. Evidence that earlier offenses may have been overlooked further stoked outrage.
The full horrific details of his crimes are deeply concerning and raise entirely legitimate questions,”l the department said. “We completely hear the legitimate concerns being raised and we know women are worried. All our officers are concerned about the impact of these horrific crimes on trust in the police and we want to do all we can to rebuild that trust.” Couzens, 48, this week was sentenced to life in prison without the possibly of parole after pleading guilty to Everard’s murder on the night of March 3, 2020.
Confidence in the police was further shaken this month when primary school teacher Sabina Nessa, 28, was killed Sept. 17 as she walked through a park to meet a friend. Police stressed that it was rare for a solo officer to question a woman and said it was entirely reasonable for women to seek assurances about the identity of the officer if they found themselves in such a situation. Police advised women to ask the officer searching questionsnabout the absence of other officers, why the officer was in the area and exactly why the subject was being stopped. If after doing so a woman still feels she is in danger, she should shout to others on the street, knock on doors, wave down a passing bus or call 999, Britain’s emergency phone number, the police said.
Lawmaker Jess Phillips, the opposition Labour Party’s spokesperson on domestic violence and safeguarding, said authorities need to develop a comprehensive strategy to protect women, not keep asking women and girls to do more to protect themselves.
I could scream, if I’m honest, about the amount of things that women are told to do, she told the BBC. Sarah Everard was keeping herself completely safe. She was doing exactly what any woman would do, and still this happened to her. The onus is on the Metropolitan Police to do better.

Editorial: Danger ahead,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/09/03/editorial-danger-ahead/,"September 3, 2021",NT Bureau,Crimes,"The US needs to closely watch China as it might try to take over the Bagram air force base in Afghanistan following the Taliban’s takeover of the war-torn country and use Pakistan to get stronger to go against India, a former senior American diplomat has warned.
In July, the US military left Bagram Airfield – its key base in Afghanistan – after nearly 20 years. At its height, Bagram base was home to tens of thousands of US troops. “The biggest thing he (Biden) should do is strengthen our allies, strengthen those relationships, modernise our military, and make sure we are prepared for the cyber-crimes and the terrorist crimes that are headed our way,” she said.
She said President Joe Biden has lost the trust and confidence of American allies after his hasty decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. She said there are many challenges in front of the US.
The US needs to make sure that Americans are protected and the country’s cybersecurity is strong because actors like Russia are going to continue to hack us because we show no signs of willingness to fight back, she said.

50-year battle on drugs and its impact,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/22/50-year-battle-on-drugs-and-its-impact/,"July 22, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"Richard Nixon
Raleigh: Fifty years ago this summer, President Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs.
Today, with the US mired in a deadly opioid epidemic that did not abate during the coronavirus pandemic’s worst days, it is questionable whether anyone won the war. Yet the loser is clear: Black and Latino Americans, their families and their communities. A key weapon was the imposition of mandatory minimums in prison sentencing.
Decades later those harsh federal and state penalties led to an increase in the prison industrial complex that saw millions of people, primarily of color, locked up and shut out of the American dream.
An Associated Press review of federal and state incarceration data shows that, between 1975 and 2019, the U.S. prison population jumped from 240,593 to 1.43 million Americans. Among them, about 1 in 5 people were incarcerated with a drug offense listed as their most serious crime.
The racial disparities reveal the war’s uneven toll. Following the passage of stiffer penalties for crack cocaine and other drugs, the Black incarceration rate in America exploded from about 600 per 100,000 people in 1970 to 1,808 in 2000.
In the same timespan, the rate for the Latino population grew from 208 per 100,000 people to 615, while the white incarceration rate grew from 103 per 100,000 people to 242.
Gilberto Gonzalez, a retired special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration who worked for more than 20 years taking down drug dealers and traffickers in the U.S., Mexico and in South America, said he’ll never forget being cheered on by residents in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood near Los Angeles as he led away drug traffickers in handcuffs.
That gave me a sense of the reality of the people that live in these neighborhoods, that are powerless because they’re afraid that the drug dealers that control the street, that control the neighborhood are going to do them and their children harm, said Gonzalez, 64, who detailed his field experiences in the recently released memoir Narco Legenda.
We realised then that, along with dismantling (drug trafficking) organisations, there was also a real need to clean up communities, to go to where the crime was and help people that are helpless, he said.
Still, the law enforcement approach has led to many long-lasting consequences for people who have since reformed. Lucas still wonders what would happen for him and his family if he no longer carried the weight of a drug-related conviction on his record.
Even with his sunny disposition and close to 30 years of sober living, Lucas, at age 54, cannot pass most criminal background checks. His wife, whom he’d met two decades ago at a fatherhood counseling conference, said his past had barred him from doing things as innocuous as chaperoning their children on school field trips. It’s almost like a life sentence, he said.
Although Nixon declared the war on drugs on 17 June, 1971, the US already had lots of practice imposing drug prohibitions that had racially skewed impacts. The arrival of Chinese migrants in the 1800s saw the rise of criminalising opium that migrants brought with them. Cannabis went from being called reefer to marijuana, as a way to associate the plant with Mexican migrants arriving in the U.S. in the 1930s.
By the time Nixon sought reelection amid the anti-Vietnam War and Black power movements, criminalising heroin was a way to target activists and hippies. One of Nixon’s domestic policy aides, John Ehrlichman, admitted as much about the war on drugs in a 22-year-old interview published by Harper’s Magazine in 2016.
Experts say Nixon’s successors, Ronald Reagan, George H W Bush and Bill Clinton, leveraged drug war policies in the following decades to their own political advantage, cementing the drug war’s legacy. The explosion of the US incarceration rate, the expansion of public and private prison systems and the militarisation of local police forces are all outgrowths of the drug war.
Federal policies, such as mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses, were mirrored in state legislatures. Lawmakers also adopted felony disenfranchisement, while also imposing employment and other social barriers for people caught in drug sweeps.
The domestic anti-drug policies were widely accepted, mostly because the use of illicit drugs, including crack cocaine in the late 1980s, was accompanied by an alarming spike in homicides and other violent crimes nationwide. Those policies had the backing of Black clergy and the Congressional Black Caucus, the group of African-American lawmakers whose constituents demanded solutions and resources to stem the violent heroin and crack scourges.

Protests in Spain against suspected LGBT hate crime,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/06/protests-in-spain-against-suspected-lgbt-hate-crime/,"July 6, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"Madrid: People took to the streets of Spain’s biggest cities on Monday evening to express their anger at the death of a man in a suspected homophobic attack at the weekend.
Crowds filled a central Madrid square and activists marched down a major street in Barcelona, chanting slogans and waving placards and rainbow-coloured flags.
The response to the wave of LGBT-phobic hatred that ended the life of Samuel in A Coruna is overwhelming, the left-wing Podemos party that governs in coalition with the ruling Socialists wrote on Twitter.
The 24-year-old nursing assistant was beaten near a nightclub in the early hours of Saturday in the town of A Coruna, northern Spain, by several assailants including one who shouted a common pejorative description of a homosexual, state broadcaster RTVE reported. He later died in hospital.
Jose Minones, a local government representative in the region where A Coruna is located, tweeted that the police were working to find out what happened and to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Local media quoted him as saying the investigation would show whether or not the attack was motivated by homophobia.
Interior Ministry data shows 278 hate crimes related to sexual orientation or gender identity were reported in Spain in 2019, an 8.6% increase on the previous year. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights warns only a fraction of hate crimes are reported to the police.
In central Barcelona, 21 year-old Sergio Cuevas said: I think this crime happened because homophobia kills.

Remaining fence around US Capitol to be removed: Reports,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/07/03/remaining-fence-around-us-capitol-to-be-removed-reports/,"July 3, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"Washington: The remaining fencing that has surrounded the US Capitol since a mob of pro-Trump rioters stormed the building in January is likely to come down as soon as next week, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.
Capitol Police removed an outer fence in March that had cut off a wide swath of the area to cars and pedestrians, blocking major traffic arteries that cross the city. An interior perimeter fence has remained around the Capitol, with signs warning that the area is closed to the public.
A plan being put in place by the US Capitol Police Board calls for the fence to be removed by July 9, the people said. They could not discuss details of the plan publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
The Capitol Police Board, which has oversight of the police force, is made up of the sergeants at arms of the House and Senate and the Architect of the Capitol.
The fencing has been a stark symbol of the fear many in the Capitol felt after the mob pushed its way past overwhelmed police officers, broke through windows and doors and ransacked the Capitol as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden’s electoral win.
‘We cannot talk about security, which includes any potential physical security infrastructure plans,’ a Capitol Police spokesman said.
The fence has also become a political symbol, blocking off one of the country’s most visible public buildings as lawmakers and police work to come up with a plan to allow the public back inside but also keep the Capitol and members of Congress safe.
More than 500 people have been charged with federal crimes for their roles in the January 6 riot and dozens of others are still being sought by federal agents. Thousands of National Guard troops who were sent to assist the Capitol Police with securing the complex left months ago.
Just a few weeks after the outer fence came down in March, a man rammed his car into a police checkpoint barrier, killing a Capitol Police officer.
The driver was shot and killed after he ran his car into Police Officer Billy Evans and another officer, got out and lunged at police with a knife.
The Capitol Police Board asked congressional leaders in February to keep the fence in place until September, in part because investigators are tracking continuing threats against lawmakers and the Capitol complex.
On Wednesday, the House launched a new investigation of the January 6 attack, approving a special committee to probe the insurrection.

Tehran: Outgoing Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that the present US government still follows the anti-Tehran economic pressure policies adopted by former President Donald Trump.
Iran “has been facing an economic terrorism since three years ago. What Trump did against Iran was more a war than sanctions,” Rouhani said in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
He added that Trump’s successor Joe Biden continues committing his crimes, reports Xinhua news agency.
Rouhai also claimed that allegations against Tehran were baseless and added that the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is a document highlighting the fact that Iran does not seek nuclear weapons, state media IRNA reported.
In May 2018, Trump withdrew from the deal and unilaterally reimposed sanctions on Iran.
In response, Iran gradually stopped implementing parts of its commitments to the agreement from May 2019.
Since April 6, Iran and the P4+1, namely the UK, China, France, Russia and Germany, with the indirect involvement of the US, have conducted six rounds of negotiations in the Austrian capital aimed at reviving the JCPOA.
Despite progresses in the negotiations, the parties have announced that some serious differences were yet to be resolved.
At the end of the latest round of talks, Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi had said that it was the time for the parties to make their “decisions” over the remaining issues.

‘ISIS not just regional terror outfit but global syndicate’,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/05/12/isis-not-just-regional-terror-outfit-but-global-syndicate/,"May 12, 2021",NT Bureau,Crimes,"New Delhi: India has told the UN Security Council that the Islamic State is not just another regional terrorist outfit but a global syndicate with affiliated groups across the world, including in the country’s neighbourhood.
Deputy Permanent Representative – Political Coordinator R Ravindra said on Monday that the only accountability for acts of terror and strong measures against states that support terrorism can strengthen the credibility of the global fight against the scourge.
The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has carried out inhuman atrocities against the people of Iraq. Victims of ISIL’s horrific crimes also included 39 Indian nationals, he said at the Security Council briefing on Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/ISIL (UNITAD).
ISIL, also known as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), is a jihadist group with a violent ideology that calls itself a caliphate and claims religious authority over all Muslims Ravindra said ISIL has systematically committed genocide, torture, rape, slavery and kidnapping throughout the territory under its control in Iraq and Syria.
The Islamic State, therefore, cannot be seen as just another regional terrorist outfit. It is a global syndicate with affiliated terrorist groups across the world, including in our neighbourhood, he said.
Ravindra stressed that India strongly believed that the credibility of our collective fight against terrorism can be strengthened only when we ensure accountability for the grave and inhuman acts of terror committed by terrorists and take strong measures against states that encourage, support and finance terrorism.
Special Adviser and Head of the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da’esh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Karim Asad Ahmad Khan told the Council that based on its independent criminal investigations, UNITAD has established “clear and convincing evidence that genocide was committed by ISIL against the Yazidi as a religious group.”
He said the team has also established that numerous other international crimes were also committed against the Yezidi community, including extermination, enslavement, sexual violence, forcible transfer, persecution on religious and gender grounds, and conscription of children into an armed group.
Yazidi children were in many cases directly targeted and disproportionately impacted by Da’esh’s crimes. Anyone who escaped alive, but particularly children, carry daily the burden of the lasting effects of these crimes, he said.
Ravindra said terrorists and terrorist groups affiliated with ISIL have committed crimes against humanity in an unprecedented manner.
The perpetrators of these crimes should be brought to justice by their respective countries of origin. Sharing of information and evidence collected by UNITAD with other member states will further strengthen these efforts, he said.
Noting that the full realisation of UNITAD’s mandate would not be possible until the team is able to share its large volumes of evidence with the Iraqi authorities, Ravindra termed it unfortunate that despite a lapse of almost three years, UNITAD has been unable to service its primary client to the fullest extent possible.
Delay in sharing of evidence will further delay justice to those victims and their loved ones, whose lives have been devastated by the atrocities committed by ISIL, he said.
Ravindra said accountability for crimes committed by ISIL, especially those against various minority communities in Iraq, was critical for achieving smooth reconciliation and sustained peace in Iraq.

“After an SOP was introduced in the Armed Police, no casualty has been reported. A similar SOP will be successfully implemented for the city police,” he said.
Under this initiative, if anyone in the police force has any symptoms, s/he will be tested and quarantined immediately and necessary medical assistance will be given.
“Our officers will interact with them daily and monitor their health. We hope to see an improvement soon,” he said.
On the law and order front, Jiwal said all steps will be taken to curb the menace of rowdyism, ganja sales and black-marketing of drugs, which are classified as organised crimes.

Suspect in attack on Asian woman in NYC is arrested,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/04/01/suspect-in-attack-on-asian-woman-in-nyc-is-arrested/,"April 1, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"Washington: The suspect wanted in the brutal attack of an Asian American woman has been arrested and charged with felony assault as a hate crime, according to the New York Police Department.
The arrest, posted on the NYPD Hate Crimes’ Twitter account early Wednesday, comes after the man was seen on video kicking and stomping the woman near New York City’s Times Square on Monday. The tweet did not release the man’s identity.
The 65-year-old woman, whose name has not been made public, was discharged from the hospital Tuesday after being treated for serious injuries, a hospital spokesperson said.
Police on Tuesday blanketed the midtown Manhattan neighbourhood with wanted posters and offered a $2,500 reward for information leading to the whereabouts of the man seen on surveillance video Monday brutalizing the woman as she walked to church.
At the same time, officials admonished bystanders for doing nothing to stop the man as police say he kicked the 65-year-old woman in the stomach, knocked her to the ground, stomped on her face, shouted anti-Asian slurs and told her, you don’t belong here.
The attack Monday was among the latest in a national spike in anti-Asian hate crimes, and happened just weeks after a mass shooting in Atlanta that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent. The surge in violence has been linked in part to misplaced blame for the coronavirus and former President Donald Trump’s use of racially charged terms like Chinese virus.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called Monday’s attack absolutely disgusting and outrageous. He said it was absolutely unacceptable that witnesses did not intervene.
I don’t care who you are, I don”t care what you do, you”ve got to help your fellow New Yorker, de Blasio said, evoking the post-9/11 mantra of see something, say something.
The attack happened late Monday morning outside an apartment building two blocks from Times Square, a bustling, heavily policed section of midtown Manhattan known as the Crossroads of the World.
Two workers inside the building who appeared to be security guards were seen on surveillance video witnessing the attack but failing to come to the woman’s aid. One of them was seen closing the building door as the woman was on the ground. The attacker was able to casually walk away while onlookers watched, the video showed.
The building’s management company said they were suspended pending an investigation. The workers’ union said they called for help immediately.
If you see someone being attacked, do whatever you can, de Blasio said. Make noise. Call out what’s happening. Go and try and help. Immediately call for help. Call 911. This is something where we all have to be part of the solution. We can’t just stand back and watch a heinous act happening.
Mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, said the victim could easily have been my mother. He too criticised the bystanders, saying their inaction was exactly the opposite of what we need here in New York City.
This year in New York City there have been 33 hate crimes with an Asian victim as of Sunday, police said. There were 11 such attacks by the same time last year.
On Friday, in the same neighbourhood as Monday’s attack, a 65-year-old Asian American woman was accosted by a man waving an unknown object and shouting anti-Asian insults. A 48-year-old man was arrested the next day and charged with menacing. He is not suspected in Monday’s attack.
The NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force has asked anyone with information to contact the department’s confidential hot line or submit tips online.
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea announced last week that the department would increase outreach and patrols in predominantly Asian communities, including the use of undercover officers to prevent and disrupt attacks.
The neighbourhood where Monday’s attack occurred, Hell’s Kitchen, is predominantly white, with an Asian population of less than 20%, according to city demographic data.
Shea called Monday’s attack disgusting, telling TV station NY1: l don’t know who attacks a 65-year-old woman and leaves her on the street like that.
According to a report from Stop AAPI Hate, more than 3,795 incidents were reported to the organisation from March 19, 2020, to February 28. The group, which tracks incidents of discrimination, hate and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US, said that number is only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur.

"Editorial: Closed, but open",https://newstodaynet.com/2021/03/25/editorial-closed-but-open/,"March 25, 2021",NT Bureau,Crimes,"US President Joe Biden’s Cabinet is nearly complete with the confirmation of Labour Secretary Marty Walsh. But the work of building his administration is just beginning, as Biden has hundreds of key presidential appointments to make to fill out the federal government.
The process of building out a government, according to Paul Light, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is nasty, brutish, and not at all short. Biden has about 1,250 federal positions that require Senate confirmation, ranging from the head of the obscure Railroad Retirement Board to more urgent department positions such as assistant and deputy secretaries.
Of the 790 being tracked by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan good-government group, 23 appointees have been confirmed by the Senate, 39 are being considered by the Senate, and 466 positions have no named nominee.
According to Max Stier, president and CEO of the partnership, filling out those key posts will likely take the better part of the year and those vacancies have real-world consequences. Many agencies, he said, have various sections that have leadership that really runs that specific component. Aside from Walsh, who was confirmed Monday by a 68-29 vote, there are a few finishing touches for his Cabinet-level appointees.
The Senate is yet to confirm Eric Lander as Biden’s top science adviser, and the White House still has not named anyone to head his Budget office, after Neera Tanden withdrew her nomination amid controversy. The White House is facing pressure from lawmakers on Capitol Hill to name Shalanda Young, the current nominee for deputy budget director, to the top role.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has set up confirmation votes this week for Young, along with Vivek Murthy for surgeon general and Rachel Leland Levine for assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, among others, before the Senate adjourns for recess until mid-April. Beneath the Cabinet heads that have been confirmed are numerous sub-departments that remain leaderless.
Many have only acting heads in place even as the administration faces a number of pressing situations in addition to the coronavirus pandemic. Recent crimes against Asian Americans have sparked fresh debate over the nation’s gun laws, but Biden has reportedly yet to nominate anyone to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. And the wave of migrants at the border is underscoring major challenges in enforcing immigration and asylum laws.

TN leaders up pressure on PM over UN resolution against SL,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/03/22/tn-leaders-up-pressure-on-pm-over-un-resolution-against-sl/,"March 22, 2021",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: DMK president MK Stalin and other leaders have urged the Union government leaders to support the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution against Sri Lanka for war crimes against Tamils in the island nation.
In a statement, Stalin sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to gather the support of other member States and ensure the adoption of the resolution with adequate amendments.
“I urge the Prime Minister not to take a stand against the resolution of the United Nations,” he said.
Recalling the interviews of Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Jayanath Colombage that India has assured support to his country, Stalin said the silence of Modi and his failure to clarify his position had created shock among the Sri Lankan Tamils.
MDMK chief Vaiko said the BJP-led Centre won’t be forgiven if they favour Sri Lanka. The LTTE fought for an independent homeland for Tamil in Sri Lanka and was found responsible for assassinating former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in Sriperumbudur over the issue.
PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss wrote to External Affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Sunday requesting to vote for the resolution on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka.
He recalled that Modi in a public meeting in Chennai in February had assured that India was committed to ensuring that Tamils lived in Sri Lanka in peace, dignity and equality.
“Justice for Tamils killed in the 2009 genocide in Sri Lanka remains elusive for the victims after 12 years,” Ramadoss said in his statement.
“Peace in Sri Lanka and maintaining India’s position as the dominant ally are vital for our national interests,” he said and added that Sri Lanka has changed its position with India and taken its relationship with China to a higher level.

Parental involvement can prevent teen delinquency: Study,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/02/25/parental-involvement-can-prevent-teen-delinquency-study/,"February 25, 2021",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: In yet another study that links juvenile delinquent behaviour to poor social and academic skills, a new research has found that youngsters who feel they have empathic support from their parents and caregivers are verging away from a wide range of delinquent behaviour, such as committing crimes.
The study, based on data surveying children over a four year period from when they were aged 12 to 17, shows that those who received empathy were less likely to execute acts of serious delinquent behaviour, compared to those who simply felt they had supportive parents.
In addition, the new findings demonstrate that parents/caregivers who display greater empathy enhance their teenagers’ own development of empathy, or the ability to acknowledge and understand the feelings of others.
The results follow an investigation of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children data source, which features a series of interviews with 3,865 boys and girls across Australia over the period when delinquent behaviour first tends to appear.
Author of the paper, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Moral Education, Prof. Glenn Walters from Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, USA, states his findings demonstrate that parental support, as perceived by the child, plays a ‘small but significant role’ in the development of empathy in early adolescent youth.
“Empathy in youth also appears to have the power to mediate the negative association between perceived parental support and future juvenile delinquency,” said the Associate Professor of Criminal Justice.
The study was launched to expand on results of several previous articles which investigated the relationship between parental support and delinquent behaviour in teenagers. The proposition is that strong parental support reduces the propensity for such behaviour. However, the results have been mixed.
Forensic psychologist Professor Walters, after his research, conceded that other factors such as social interest and self-esteem may also play a role in mediating the relationship between parental support and teenage delinquency, and says these factors should be explored in future research.

Leader of fake Covid vaccine scam arrested in China,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/02/17/leader-of-fake-covid-vaccine-scam-arrested-in-china/,"February 17, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"Beijing: A batch of the vaccines were smuggled overseas, but it is not known where they were sent to. Kong is among 70 people who have been arrested for similar crimes.
The leader of a multi-million dollar scam that passed off saline solution and mineral water as Covid-19 vaccines has been arrested in China.
The man, identified as Kong, had researched the packaging designs of real vaccines before making more than 58,000 of his own concoctions, the BBC reported on Tuesday.
A batch of the vaccines were smuggled overseas, but it is not known where they were sent to. Kong is among 70 people who have been arrested for similar crimes.
The arrests, involving more than 20 cases, came as Beijing vowed to crack down on fraudulent vaccines.
Even though most of the cases surfaced late last year, new details were released this week.
According to a court ruling, Kong and his team made a profit of 18 million yuan ($2.78 million) by putting saline solution or mineral water in syringes and hawking them as Covid vaccines since August last year.
A batch of 600 of these vaccines were sent to Hong Kong last November, before they were shipped abroad. The sales were made on the basis the vaccines were acquired via internal channels of genuine manufacturers.
In other cases, counterfeit vaccines were sold at inflated prices in hospitals. Other criminals also conducted inoculation programmes of their own and had village doctors vaccinate people with fake jabs in their homes and cars.
China’s highest prosecuting body, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate has urged regional agencies to cooperate with the police to curb such activities.
Officials had hoped to administer 100 million Covid doses before the Lunar New Year last week, but has only vaccinated 40 million people so far. However, the country has largely managed to bring the pandemic under control with strict lockdown, testing and tracing measures.

New Delhi: Pieter Friedrich, who was in the headlines since Monday evening following a press conference by the Delhi Police, has described himself as a ‘freelance journalist and analyst of South Asian affairs’.
He has responded to the allegations against him on a post on Medium early on Tuesday.
In the post, titled Modi Regime Attacks Pieter Friedrich for Striking Against RSS’s Fascist Agenda, Friedrich declared he had “absolutely zero involvement” with the Khalistani movement today.
‘As the Khalistan movement today—with which I have absolutely zero involvement—appears to me to be entirely propped up by the Modi regime for purposes of creating a Frankenstein monster on which it can blame all ills, it seems to serve no other purpose than as a Modi regime psy-op to distract attention from the crimes of the RSS-BJP. It’s laughable that the entire world today—from a white Christian writer like myself to a Black Barbadian singer like Rihanna—are labeled as supporters of a fictitious Sikh separatist state,’ Friedrich wrote.
Friedrich was named for his alleged involvement in the ‘toolkit’ case, which erupted after climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted a Google toolkit for protest activities related to the ongoing farmers’ protests in India.
According to a report by media watchdog the Disinfolab, Friedrich was a crucial resource person in the farmers’ protests, whose name was dropped accidentally by Thunberg in the toolkit. He had claimed to be part of protesters who vandalized Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in the USA.
Friedrich is said to have been in contact with Bhajan Singh Bhinder, a known Khalistani. He is also associated with the K2 (Kashmir-Khalistan) conspiracy.

Thomas Caldwell, who authorities believe holds a leadership role in the extremist group, worked as section chief for the FBI from 2009 to 2010 after retiring from the Navy, his lawyer, Thomas Plofchan, wrote in a motion urging the judge to release him from jail while he awaits trial.
The defense said Caldwell, who has denied being part of the Oath Keepers, has held a top-secret security clearance since 1979, which required multiple special background investigations, according to Plofchan. Caldwell also ran a consulting firm that did classified work for the U.S. government, the lawyer said.
He has been vetted and found numerous times as a person worthy of the trust and confidence of the United States government, as indicated by granting him Top Secret clearances,’ Plofchan wrote.
The FBI did not immediately comment Monday evening.
Caldwell is one of three people authorities have described as Oath Keepers who were charged last month with conspiracy and accused of plotting the attack on the Capitol in advance. He has been locked up since his arrest at his home in Berryville, Virginia, on January 19.
Caldwell’s lawyer said he denies ever going into the Capitol and has physical limitations that would prevent the 66-year-old from forcing his way into any building.
Caldwell’s lawyer said his client retired as a lieutenant commander with the Navy and that he was a 100% disabled veteran. Caldwell suffered from complications related to a service-connected injury, including shoulder, back and knee issues, the attorney said. In 2010, Caldwell had spinal surgery, which later failed and led to chronic spinal issues and a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the court filing.
Charging documents show messages between Caldwell and the others about arranging hotel rooms in the Washington area in the days before the siege. In one Facebook message from to Caldwell, one the others says: Will probably call you tomorrow … mainly because… I like to know wtf plan is. You are the man COMMANDER. Authorities say the Oath Keepers communicated during the attack about where lawmakers were.
At one point during the siege, Caldwell received a message that said all members are in the tunnels under the capital, according to court documents. ‘Seal them in turn on gas,’ it said.
Other messages read: Tom all legislators are down in the Tunnels 3floors down and go through back house chamber doors facing N left down hallway down steps,’ according to court documents.
Caldwell is among roughly 200 people charged so far in the siege for federal crimes such as disrupting Congress, disorderly conduct and assault. A special group of prosecutors is weighing whether to bring sedition charges, officials have said.
Several members of the Proud Boys, a far-right, male-chauvinist extremist group that seized on the Trump administration’s policies, have also been charged with conspiracy and accused of working together during the siege."
Tamil groups describe peace march in Lanka success,https://newstodaynet.com/2021/02/09/tamil-groups-describe-peace-march-in-lanka-success/,"February 9, 2021",Agency,Crimes,"Colombo: Tamil political groups in Sri Lanka on Monday claimed their four-day march in the east and northern part of the country to highlight the grievances of the community members in the island nation was a success despite attempts to stop it.
The protest march started on February 3 from Pottuvil town in the eastern Ampara district and ended at Polikandy in the northern Jaffna district.
The organisers had dubbed it the P2P March, indicating the first letter of the starting and end point.
Shanakian Rasmanickam, a member of Parliament for the Eastern province from the main Tamil party Tamil National Alliance, said the crowd participation had exceeded their expectations.
He said the organisers were bolstered by the joining of Muslim minority political groups.
The protest march came days after the UN Human Rights Office called for an “international action to ensure justice for international crimes” allegedly committed during the 26-year civil war in the country.
Sri Lanka has rejected the report. The protest highlighted several issues being faced by the Tamil community in Lanka.
The protesters allege that lands owned by Tamils are being grabbed and Tamil areas are being systematically populated with the majority Sinhala community since the military conflict ended in 2009 in Lanka.
They also claim that Tamil political prisoners continue to languish in jails under the prevention of terrorism laws.
The organisers said the court orders were served on politicians, preventing them from taking part in the peaceful protest march.
Abraham Sumanthiran, a leading TNA parliamentarian, said the security provided to him by the police’s special task force (STF) had been withdrawn immediately after the march ended.
He had been provided with the security by the STF due to threats to his life, he said.
He said he is yet to be informed of the decision to remove his special security or on the reasons for the decision.
As per UN figures, up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the security forces during the then president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s regime that brought an end to nearly three decades of civil war in Sri Lanka with the defeat of LTTE in 2009.
Both the government troops and the Tamil Tiger rebels are accused of war crimes.

Chennai: Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar replied in the negative when asked in the Lok Sabha if the government proposes to give compensation to the families of farmers who have died during the ongoing agitation against new farm laws.
The Minister was replying to a written question by several Lok Sabha MPs related to dialogue with farmer organisations.
Tomar said some of the farmers’ unions and their members have been agitating against the newly-enacted farm laws.
When asked specifically if the government was aware that a number of farmer protesters have died or fallen ill’ while agitating, Tomar said the government during discussion with these farmers’ unions ‘appealed many times that children and elders including women should be requested to go home in view of the cold and Covid situation and other hardships’.
On whether the government proposes to give compensation to the families of the farmers who have died during the agitation, the minister replied: ‘No Sir’.
Tomar informed the Lower House that the government is negotiating with the farmer unions.
“So far, 11 rounds of meetings have been held between the government and agitating farmers’ unions to resolve the issues. Government had put forth one proposal after another to amend the farm laws,” he said.
Tomar said the demands of agitating farmer unions were related to the three farm Acts — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.
The recent farm reform laws’ implementation has been stayed at present by the Supreme Court, he added.
The responsibilities of maintaining law and order, including investigation, registration / prosecution of crimes, conviction of accused, protection of life and property etc. rests primarily with the respective State governments.
“Central government keeps a constant watch on activities of individuals and organisations having bearing on national security and public order through its security and law enforcement agencies. Requisite action is taken as per law, whenever necessary,” Rai said.

Chouhan’s comments come in the backdrop of a controversy over web series ‘Tandav’ and the registration of multiple FIRs in many states, including Madhya Pradesh, against its makers for hurting religious sentiments.
“Obscene content is being served on OTT platforms. Young children are also getting affected due to the internet and mobile phones. After seeing such content on mobile phones, a 12-year-old boy recently misbehaved with a six-year-old girl,” Chouhan said.
He was speaking at the launch of PANKH abhiyan as part of the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ drive.
“Young minds are getting affected by such content. Shouldn’t such content be censored? Children are like a soft clay and learn what they watch. The Government of India is considering it (censor on OTT) seriously,” the senior BJP leader said.
An over-the-top is a streaming media service offered directly to viewers via the Internet. OTT bypasses cable, broadcast, and satellite television platforms. Chouhan said the people who commit crimes against women will not be spared.
Similarly, drug mafia who makes youth addicted to drugs won’t be spared. Drugs ruin lives. These criminals make young children and girls drug addicts and force them to commit wrong deeds. Young children commit criminal acts by watching pornographic videos. Government and society should come together to stop such cases, he said.

Biden’s son facing federal investigation into his taxes,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/12/10/bidens-son-facing-federal-investigation-into-his-taxes/,"December 10, 2020",Agency,Crimes,"Washington: US President-elect Joe Biden’s son Hunter has said that he is facing a federal investigation into his taxes, putting a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father’s campaign.
Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. The tax investigation centres on his business dealings, the person said.
The Justice Department’s investigation, centring on potential tax fraud crimes, had been going on at least a year before President-elect Biden announced his candidacy, according to another person familiar with the matter. Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior because of a Justice Department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts.
In a statement released by the president-elect’s transition office on Wednesday, Hunter Biden said he learned about the investigation on Tuesday but did not disclose specifics about what was being scrutinised.
I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors, he said in a statement.
He has long been a target of President Donald Trump and his allies, who have accused him of profiting off his political connections. Trump and his supporters also raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption related to Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice president and leading the Obama administration’s dealings with the Eastern European nation.
The disclosure of the federal investigation, led by the US attorney’s office in Delaware, comes at an awkward moment for the incoming president, who is assembling his Cabinet. His pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation into the new president’s son if it is still ongoing when Biden is sworn in on January 20.
The transition team said in a statement: “President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.”
Hunter Biden’s attorneys did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment.
Biden’s younger son has been caught up in controversies before. While his father was vice president, Hunter joined the Naval Reserve only to be discharged after testing positive for cocaine in his system, later revealing a yearslong struggle with addiction.
He also joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the elder Biden was deeply involved in US policy toward Ukraine.
A Republican-led Senate investigation did not identify any policies that were directly affected by Hunter Biden”s work.
In the weeks before the election, Trump supporters used the existence of a laptop they said was connected to Hunter Biden — and the emergence of someone who maintains he had business discussions with him — to raise questions about Joe Biden”s knowledge of his son”s activities in Ukraine and China.
The President-elect has said he did not discuss his son’s international business dealings with him and has denied having ever taken money from a foreign country.
The laptop surfaced publicly in October when The New York Post reported on emails that it said had come from Hunter Biden’s laptop and that it said it received from Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer.

New Delhi: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today said we need to continue our efforts to address the threats of bio-terrorism and pandemic diseases.
He said this during his address at the ASEAN defence ministers’ meeting plus (ADMM-Plus).
“Threats to the rules-based order, maritime security, cyber related crimes and terrorism, just to name a few, remain the challenges that we need to address as a forum,” Rajnath said on the occasion of the meeting’s 10th anniversary.
He said that the collective achievement in the past decade has been remarkable in advancing multilateral cooperation through strategic dialogue and practical security cooperation.
“ADMM has grown in the last decade to become the fulcrum of peace, stability and rules-based order in this region,” he said.
Rajnath added that exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoiding actions that may further complicate the situation, will go a long way in bringing sustained peace to the region.

Banks need to hire chief risk officers,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/12/07/banks-need-to-hire-chief-risk-officers/,"December 7, 2020",NT Bureau,Crimes,"New Delhi: The banking industry needs to upgrade its IT infrastructure and appoint experienced chief risk officers to effectively deal with incidence of cybercrimes, a report by Deloitte India said.
Observing that banks are the most targeted sector, the report said that nearly 22 per cent of cybersecurity attacks which took place in India in 2018-19 were on the banking industry.
“…these (cyber) attacks are becoming complex day by day. To address these challenges, banks need to appoint experienced Chief Risk Officers who can take the responsibility of skilling the employees and lead investment in military-grade cybersecurity solutions to detect the most advanced attacks,” said the Deloitte report on ‘Digitizing the post Covid world: The ‘3I’ approach’.
The banking sector, the report added, has been fast to adapt to the changing demands by accelerating efforts toward contactless business operations and speeding up digital transition to enable employees to work from home post the lockdown. As a result of the technology integration, the sector has been facing several challenges with respect to ensuring data security, the report said.
It noted that the year 2020 has been quite challenging for Indian banks when it comes to cybersecurity. After the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, banking operations were disrupted severely as banks struggled to provide uninterrupted services to their clients during various stages of lockdowns. In the following months, they accelerated their digital transition efforts (such as digital banking and remote access to employees) to ensure contactless business operations.
“With a surge in digitisation, banks also witnessed a spike in cyber attacks as cybercriminals found new opportunities and vulnerabilities,” it said.
Munjal Kamdar, Partner, Deloitte India said banks will likely adopt technologies such as mobile, cloud, remote access out of the need to sustain business during the pandemic and thrive thereafter.

"Australian PM overreacted to tweet, says Chinese official",https://newstodaynet.com/2020/12/04/australian-pm-overreacted-to-tweet-says-chinese-official/,"December 4, 2020",Agency,Crimes,"Scott Morrison
Canberra: China’s senior diplomat in Australia said Prime Minister Scott Morrison overreacted to a social media post about alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, adding that his actions drew more attention to the report.
Earlier this week, Morrison said that a Chinese official’s tweet showing the fake image of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child’s throat was truly repugnant and merits an apology, which has not come from China.
I think it’s unfortunate that this issue evolved in such a way that has gone astray and now there is a much larger visibility of the Brereton report in China, China’s deputy ambassador, Wang Xining, said Friday.
More people are attentive to what happened in Afghanistan. People wonder why a national leader would have such a strong opinion to an artwork done by a normal young artist in China. He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia’s military earlier this month that found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan.
It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
It followed a four-year investigation by Maj. Gen. Paul Brereton, a judge and army reservist who was asked to look into the allegations and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.
Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.
Zhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable. Many of Australia’s allies have been critical of the tweet, with the European Union calling it irresponsible.
We consider the deliberate dissemination of a fabricated image via social media accounts affiliated with China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be irresponsible, insensitive, and not at all constructive, particularly given the subject in question, said an EU spokesman.
Such behaviour and use of information tools to disseminate fabricated images or information cannot be justified.
Officials from the United States, New Zealand and Canada have also criticized the Chinese tweet.
The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.
China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports, most recently to its lucrative wine industry.

Navalny urges EU to be ready for Russian election,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/11/28/navalny-urges-eu-to-be-ready-for-russian-election/,"November 28, 2020",Agency,Crimes,"Alexei Navalny
Moscow: Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny urged the European Union to reject the results of Russia’s parliamentary election next year if any candidates are blocked from taking part and he called Friday on the EU to impose sanctions on oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny, a corruption investigator and longtime foe of Putin’s, has been recovering in Germany from a poisoning attack with what experts have said was a Soviet-era nerve agent. He told EU lawmakers he thinks it’s important that Europe not remain silent on conditions in Russia.
Navalny described next September’s election for Russia’s lower house of parliament as an absolutely crucial event. He said that while he and other opposition politicians expect some vote-rigging, what is most important is the right to participate.
Navalny, who has been blocked several times from registering as a candidate, said the EU’s approach should simply be: “If everyone is allowed to participate, we can discuss it further. But if some are not allowed to participate, the results of such an election will never be recognized”.
He urged the 27-nation bloc to change its approach to sanctions, saying there is little point in slapping travel bans or asset freezes over poisonings or election irregularities on military officers because they generally don’t move much outside of Russia, own real estate or hold bank accounts in Europe.
Navalny said the EU should ask itself why these alleged crimes are happening. The answer is very, very simple: money, he told EU lawmakers via video-link. ‘So, the European Union should target the money, and Russian oligarchs notably the new circle of the ultra-rich business people around Putin. Navalny said most Russian citizens would support such an approach.
Last month, EU foreign ministers imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute over Navalny’s poisoning. Russia announced retaliatory action, saying that it would target French and German officials close to the leaders of France and Germany. Vladimir Kara-Murza, head of the Boris Nemtsov Foundation in Russia, urged the EU to stay true to its values.
Stop enabling those corrupt, abusive officials and oligarchs who want to steal from our people in Russia and enjoy their loot in European Union countries by spending their holidays, sending their wives and their mistresses on shopping trips, buying up yachts and real estate properties and so on, he said.

EU unveils plan to address LGBT rights,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/11/13/eu-unveils-plan-to-address-lgbt-rights/,"November 13, 2020",Agency,Crimes,"London: The European Union unveiled Thursday its first strategy for improving the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, intersex and queer people, amid deep concern about widespread discrimination, notably in Poland.
The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, wants to extend the list of crimes in Europe to cover homophobic hate speech, propose new laws to guarantee that same-sex parenthood will be recognized across the 27 member nations, and to ensure that LGBTQI concerns are better reflected in the bloc’s policies.
This is not about ideology. This is not about being men or women. This is about love, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova said. This strategy is not against anyone. This does not put anyone on a pedestal. But it is about guaranteeing safety and non-discrimination for everyone.
The commission said some progress is being made toward LGBTQI equality, but that according to a European Fundamental Rights survey in 2019, about 43 per cent of people still feel discriminated against based on their sexual orientations and gender identities. Coronavirus lockdowns are thought to be making things worse by forcing some young people to remain in places where they might face violence, hostility and bullying or suffer anxiety or depression.
In Poland, for example, the president and some other officials in the right-wing government have cast the movement for civil rights for LGBT people as a threat to families led by heterosexual couples and to the country’s Roman Catholic values. Dozens of towns in conservative parts of eastern and southern Poland have passed symbolic resolutions declaring themselves free from “LGBT ideology.” The rise in hostility has left many Poles who identify as gay, bisexual, lesbian or transgender living in anger or fear, and some have emigrated.

"Facebook, Twitter CEOs ordered to testify by GOP senators",https://newstodaynet.com/2020/10/24/facebook-twitter-ceos-ordered-to-testify-by-gop-senators/,"October 24, 2020",Agency,Crimes,"Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey
Washington: The GOP push against Facebook and Twitter accelerated Thursday after Republican senators threatened the CEOs of the social media companies with subpoenas to force them to address accusations of censorship in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign.
With Democrats boycotting the hearing, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the legal orders if Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey did not agree to testify voluntarily.
The committee wants to hear from them about “the suppression and/or censorship of two news articles from the New York Post,” according to the subpoena document.
Senators also want information from the executives about their companies’ policies for moderating content “that may interfere” with federal elections. Representatives of Facebook and Twitter declined comment.
The urgency ratcheted higher Thursday as US officials said Russian hackers have targeted the networks of dozens of state and local governments in recent days, stealing data from at least two servers.
The revelation was certain to stoke fears that Americans’ confidence in the November 3 election results could be undermined.
Russia backed President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign through hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign. Facebook became an unwitting conduit for misinformation and election disruption.
Facebook and Twitter acted last week to limit the online dissemination and sharing of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post that targeted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
The story, which other publications have not confirmed, cited unverified emails from Biden’s son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump’s allies. One email purported to show a top adviser for Burisma, the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, thanking Biden for giving him an opportunity to meet the elder Biden, who was vice president at the time.
Trump’s campaign seized on the report, though the account raised more questions than answers, including whether emails at the centre of the story were hacked or fabricated. The FBI is investigating whether the emails are part of a foreign influence operation.
It was the first time in recent memory that the two social media platforms enforced rules against misinformation on a story from a mainstream media publication.
With the election looming, Facebook and Twitter have scrambled to stem the tide of material seen as potentially inciting violence and spreading disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories.
Facebook has expanded its restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. Trump has raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
The companies also have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene in speech on their platforms.
With Trump leading the way, conservatives have stepped up their claims that Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, are biased, charging without evidence Silicon Valley’s social media platforms are deliberately suppressing conservative views.
The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.
Trump signed an executive order this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.
The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation, on a bipartisan vote, recently authorized subpoenas for Zuckerberg, Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The three have agreed to testify for a hearing planned for next week.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that they say can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized the CEOs for failing to police content, focusing on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the United States.
In 2017, following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, tech giants began banning extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence. Facebook extended the ban to white nationalists.
From both political parties, the companies have come under increasing scrutiny in Washington and from state attorneys general over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech.
On Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark antitrust case against Google, accusing it of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to boost profits. It was the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since the groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
Facebook, Amazon and Apple also have been targets of antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

He has alleged that the girl’s family didn’t like their friendship and had raised objection to it. Sandeep Singh has written that on the day of incident on 14 September, he met the girl in the field.
“Came to know from the villagers that the girl was beaten up by her family members and she was injured. She later succumbed,” said Sandeep Singh in the letter to probe agencies.
In the letter, which bears thumb impressions of Sandeep and the other three accused, Sandeep writes, “She belonged to my village. I was friends with her. Sometimes, she would talk to me over the phone. Her family did not like it.”
Rakesh, the father of one of the other accused, Ramkumar (alias Ramu), said, “It was common knowledge in the village that the deceased and Sandeep knew each other. This was not acceptable to the families, and Sandeep’s family had sent him away. On the day of the incident, he had come to the village and was talking to her when her mother noticed them.”

State of mind to commit a particular crime ‘must be visible’ to determine the culpability for offence of abetment, said the apex court. It said that ingredient of ‘mens rea’ (intention) cannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be visible and conspicuous.
This was said by a bench headed by Justice N V Ramana while setting aside the March 2010 order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which had upheld the trial court’s verdict convicting the man for the offence under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code.
“As in all crimes, mens rea has to be established. To prove the offence of abetment, as specified under sec 107 of the IPC, the state of mind to commit a particular crime must be visible, to determine the culpability,” said the court.
The bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy, said that in order to prove mens rea, there has to be something on record to establish or show that the man had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind, abetted the suicide of his wife. The SC delivered its verdict on a plea filed by the man against the order of High Court which had dismissed his appeal and upheld the four-year jail term awarded to him by the trial court in the case. The court noted that there is no direct evidence of cruelty against the husband or the in-laws in the case.

A bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah took note of the plea of the Uttar Pradesh government and stayed the HC’s bail order and sought response of the accused leader on the petition.

A long-time political prisoner before she came to power, Suu Kyi was once admired for her non-violent struggle against Myanmar’s military rule and she won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
But in recent years, she has been rejected internationally for Myanmar’s oppression of the Rohingya. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighboring Bangladesh to escape the army’s brutal counterinsurgency campaign in 2017.
The decision (…) to exclude Aung San Suu Kyi formally from all activities of the community of Sakharov Prize laureates is a response to her failure to act and her acceptance of the ongoing crimes against the Rohingya community in Myanmar, the EU Parliament said in a statement.

London: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is set to fight for his freedom in a British court after a decade of legal drama, as he challenges American authorities’ attempt to extradite him on spying charges over the site’s publication of secret US Military documents.
Lawyers for Assange and the US Government are scheduled to face off in London Monday at an extradition hearing that was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.
American prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges adding up to a maximum sentence of 175 years. His lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle press freedom and put journalists at risk. Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson said the case is fundamentally about basic human rights and freedom of speech.
“Journalists and whistle-blowers who reveal illegal activity by companies or governments and war crimes – such as the publications Julian has been charged for – should be protected from prosecution,” she said.
American prosecutors say Assange is a criminal, not a free-speech hero. They allege that Assange conspired with US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Geneva: Marking the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Violence Based on Religious Belief, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged the international community to make efforts to put an end to hate and discrimination.
While warning of a rise in racism since the coronavirus spread across the world, the UN chief in his message on Saturday noted that the pandemic has been accompanied by a surge in stigma and racist discourse vilifying communities, spreading vile stereotypes and assigning blame, Xinhua news agency reported.
Guterres listed some of the disturbing examples of discrimination against religious minorities, such as attacks on people and religious sites, and hate crimes and atrocity crimes targeting populations because of their religion or belief.
In order to counter this discrimination, he called for more action to address the root causes of intolerance and discrimination by promoting inclusion and respect for diversity, as well as for the perpetrators of crimes of this nature to be held accountable.
The right to freedom of religion or belief is firmly entrenched in international human rights law, said the Secretary-General, adding and is a cornerstone for inclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies.
Marked annually on August 22, the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Violence Based on Religious Belief was created by a UN resolution adopted in May 2019.
It came as response to a rise of intolerance and violence based on religion or belief against individuals, which are often of a criminal nature.
Launching his Strategy on Hate Speech in June 2019, Guterres said that a groundswell of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, violent misogyny, anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred are being seen around the world, and noted that, in some places, Christian communities were also being systematically attacked.

Kabul begins release of final 400 Talibans,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/08/15/kabul-begins-release-of-final-400-talibans/,"August 15, 2020",Agency,Crimes,"Kabul: Afghanistan has released the first 80 of a final 400 Taliban prisoners, paving the way for negotiations between the warring sides in Afghanistan’s protracted conflict, the government said Friday.
Javid Faisal, spokesman for the National Security Council’s office, made the announcement.
Taliban officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media, said 86 prisoners were freed. It wasn’t immediately known when the remaining prisoners would be freed.
Prisoner releases on both sides are part of an agreement signed in February between the US and Taliban. It calls for the release of 5,000 Taliban held by the government and 1,000 government and military personnel held by the insurgent group as a good will gesture ahead of intra-Afghan negotiations.
Talks are expected to be held in Qatar where the Taliban maintain a political office. Several Afghan leaders told The Associated Press talks could begin by 20 August.
These negotiations are to lay out a framework for a post-war Afghanistan. Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad spent a year-and-a-half negotiating the peace deal aimed at allowing American troops to return home and end America’s longest military engagement.
US troops have already begun leaving and by November less than 5,000 troops are expected to still be in Afghanistan down from nearly 13,000 when the agreement was signed 29 February.
American and NATO troop withdrawal is contingent on the Taliban keeping their commitment not to allow militant groups to use Afghanistan against the United States or its allies. The withdrawal is not tied to successful talks between the warring sides.
Last weekend, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani held a traditional council meeting known as loya jirga to get a consensus on the release of a final 400 Taliban he said were accused of serious crimes, saying without explanation that he could not unilaterally decide to release them.
Some of the 400 have been implicated in devastating bombings in Kabul. During a televised talk on Thursday with the US-based Council of Foreign Relations, Ghani warned of dangers they could present to lasting peace in Afghanistan.
But for some in Afghanistan the talks with the Taliban mirror earlier negotiations with other insurgents, including warlord and US-designated terrorist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who many say has a reputation for violence that exceeds the Taliban.
In 2016, Ghani negotiated a peace deal with Hekmatyar, whose Hezb-e-Islami group took responsibility for several bombings in Kabul, including one at a grocery story in the capital that killed a young family.
The deal included removing Hekmatyar from the UN terrorist list. His group was also responsible for a 2008 attack on French soldiers — the largest international loss in a single battle in Afghanistan.

Ex-lawyer Michael Cohen reveals Trump’s tax fraud,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/08/15/ex-lawyer-michael-cohen-reveals-trumps-tax-fraud/,"August 15, 2020",Agency,Crimes,"Michael Cohen
London: Donald Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen has released a teaser of his tell-all book, in which he claims of helping the US President commit tax fraud and create a back channel to Russia’s Vladimir Putin, it was reported on Friday.
I know where the skeletons are buried because I was the one who buried them, the Metro newspaper quoted an excerpt from Cohen’s book, titled Disloyal: A Memoir.
The true story of the former personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump. In some ways, I knew him better than even his family did because I bore witness to the real man, in strip clubs, shady business meetings, and in the unguarded moments when he revealed who he really was: a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.
Cohen, who is serving a three year sentence for multiple crimes including lying to Congress, admitted to being a demented follower who acted as Trump’s bully, fixer and designated thug.
I stiffed contractors on his behalf, ripped off his business partners, lied to his wife Melania to hide his sexual infidelities, and bullied and screamed at anyone who threatened Trump’s path to power, the excerpt said.
From golden showers in a sex club in Vegas, to tax fraud, to deals with corrupt officials from the former Soviet Union, to catch and kill conspiracies to silence Trump’s clandestine lovers, I wasn’t just a witness to the President’s rise—I was an active and eager participant.
Cohen also addressed the investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and his role on the Trump Tower Moscow project, the Metro newspaper reported.
When Cohen pleaded guilty, he admitted that he lied when he told Congress that the discussions about the project ended before Trump’s campaign began in earnest. In truth, he said, they continued well into 2016 campaign.
In his book he claims Trump cheated in the election with ‘Russian connivance’, though he does not say how. He says Trump tried to insinuate himself into Putin’s world and his coterie of corrupt billionaire oligarchs.
In a court filing, Cohen also said that the book will provide graphic and unflattering details about the President’s behaviour behind closed doors.
He said the book will be based on personal anecdotes and documentary evidence. Cohen makes clear that he speaks from a position of knowledge, saying that for 10 years, he was Trump’s last call at night and first in the morning and that he was in and out of Trump’s office 50 times a day.
Cohen was released from prison in May amid concerns over coronavirus but was returned in early July after tweeting about plans to publish the book. The book is expected to be published in full in September.

"Rise in crime during lockdown in Chennai, suburbs",https://newstodaynet.com/2020/07/08/rise-in-crime-during-lockdown-in-chennai-suburbs/,"July 8, 2020",Naomi N,Crimes,"Chennai: Journalist Pramod, who works for a Tamil Magazine was waiting near Saidapet to meet a source for the story he was working on.
He was sitting at the bus stop and checking WhatsApp on his phone when a bike-borne man snatched it and fled. It all happened so fast that Pramod did not have time to process what was happening.
This is a one-off case which denotes that crime is on the rise in the city due to the series of lockdowns impacting the day-to-day life of people.
In the past few weeks, the city has been witnessing an increase in phone snatching, vehicle theft and house break-ins.
In the beginning phase of the lockdown, the city police recorded zero cases of crime, however, things began panning out differently.
Sample this, after a series of robberies in houses in Tambaram, the police, with the help of CCTV visuals, they found it was ‘known offenders’ and arrested three men aged between 22-25 who allegedly said thst they were out of cash and took to robbery. Such cases are being reported once in two-three days at most police stations.
“Most of the men being arrested are all habitual offenders”, a police source said. He said that the city police were aware of the scenario, unlike the initial presumption that a lockdown meant there would not be any instances of crime.
Kumararaja, a resident and activist from Velacheri says, “In two weeks, two vehicles thefts took place in his neighbourhood. Other instances such as cycles being stolen, crates of milks lifted from shops in the early mornings and theft of iron and other things are also being reported.”
He says that many residents from neighbouring areas were calling him and asking to access CCTV visuals to find out about similar crimes.
Another trend, it is alleged that many anti-social elements were visiting houses and streets in the guise of vegetable vendors and salesmen to conduct a recce.
Many are of the opinion that the lockdown must be lifted so that, ‘residents will not have the fear of crime’.
Michael L Valan, Assistant Professor from Department of Criminology and Police Administration, D G Vaishnav College had conducted a study in April ‘Research on Fear of Crime during Covid-19 Lockdown period,’ says that the situation may get out of hand if it persists for another month.
“Around 13,000 cases domestic violence cases have been reported in the past few months in the State, imagine the number of unreported cases. The lockdown has a psychological impact on people.”
He says that in Parrys, five boys, aged below 18 were held for robbing Rs 2,500 from a vendor.
People are short of cash, they need to survive. We cannot survive on ration rice and pulses. Especially those living in the city are used to few luxuries. It is even more difficult for those who consume alcohol. With 100 days without a job, out of frustration and for survival people may commit crime.
An Inspector of Police, said that they have taken few suspicious people who are found roaming on the road on two-wheelers into custody. “We know it is a challenge, even after the lockdown is lifted and we are going to tackle this. We are expecting law and order issues and we will tackle it.”

Shiv Sena slams BJP over UP encounter,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/07/06/shiv-sena-slams-bjp-over-up-encounter/,"July 6, 2020",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Mumbai: Alleging that the Kanpur encounter in which eight policemen were killed has exposed the ‘encounter specialist Uttar Pradesh government’, the Shiv Sena has raised questions over claims of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath about ending goondaism in the State.
Stating that Uttar Pradesh is often called as ‘Uttam Pradesh’, an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said the ‘Uttam Pradesh’ now stands soaked in the blood of policemen, which is a shock for the country.
Eight police personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police, were gunned down last week at a village near Kanpur by the henchmen of gangster Vikas Dubey. Shiv Sena said there are reports of Dubey fleeing to Nepal after the incident.
“The Kanpur police killings has exposed the encounter specialist government in Uttar Pradesh,” the Shiv Sena said.
“Uttar Pradesh has faced ignominy for decades due to the gangs of goons there and their crimes. Claims have been made several times that goondaism has ended during the regime of present Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. But the Kanpur police killings have raised a big question mark on these claims,” it said.
Shiv Sena said there are more than 60 offences against the gangster, including that of murder and robbery, and wondered how come he got saved for want of evidence.
“What explanation the Yogi government has if someone alleges that the list of goons to be encountered is prepared as per the convenience of the Uttar Pradesh police and government?” it asked.

Film review: ‘Ponmagal Vandhal’ – Court-room conundrum,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/05/29/film-review-ponmagal-vandhal-court-room-conundrum/,"May 29, 2020",M BHARAT KUMAR,Crimes,"At a time when film industry is down and out with corona lockdown, comes Ponmagal Vandhal. This Jyotika-starrer may live up to its title – showing a way to the filmdom by having a digital premiere in OTT ( Amazon Prime) when theatres are shut.
Directed by JJ Fredrick, it is more an emotional fare which many say a right content for OTT release. Speaks about a victim’s fight for justice. Call it a revenge drama fought inside the four walls of a sessions court in Ooty.
In a nutshell, Ponmagal Vandhal revolves around Jyotika who wages a battle for a cause. A journey that she prefers to embark since her comeback to big screen with 36 Vayathinilae in 2015.
Here she plays a rookie lawyer Venba, who re-opens the case of a woman, found guilty of killing a few including girl children 14 years ago. As is the case with films on such genres, dialogues hold the key and there are a few running to pages. And Jyotika has dubbed them on her own voice. Fredrick, with just a few handful of characters, has tried to narrate a story with some twists and turns with a sole aim to convey a message towards the end. With Jyotika known for it much recently, has tried delivered it on screen to the T.
The film begins with an elderly woman Jyothi charged for murder(s), getting killed in an encounter by police when she tried to flee. After almost 14 years, Venba, an advocate, reopens the case with the help of her father Petition Pethuraj (Bhagyaraj).
The case is heared by judge ( Prathap Pothen). And the war of words erupt between public prosecutor Rajarathnam (Parthiban) and Venba. Why Venba takes up the cause and what she wants to convey people around forms the crux.
At places, the movie is more an emotional ride than a fiery argument that we saw growing up in such genres of films. Can’t avoid being preachy in a few scenes.
Besides Jyotika, Bhagyraj and Parthiban, there is Thyagarajan as business tycoon and philanthropist Varadarajan. A predictable role for him indeed and for Pandiarajan, he hardly gets any screen space.
Ramji’s cinematography capturing the hilly terrains with its natural beauty is soothing to our eyes. Govind
Vasantha’s background score compliments the crux. All said, Ponmagal Vandhal is a must today when crimes against minor girls are on a high. But had they cut the melodrama moments, she could have been bang on target. Nevertheless, a sincere attempt indeed.

Cyber cops track down those behind Army deployment rumours,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/05/29/cyber-cops-track-down-those-behind-army-deployment-rumours/,"May 29, 2020",Agency,Crimes,"Mumbai: The Maharashtra police’s cyber
wing has tracked down people who were responsible for spreading rumours on social media that the Indian Army would
be deployed in coronavirus hotspots in Mumbai and Pune, officials said on Friday.
Amid the lockdown, panic prevailed a few days ago after cyber miscreants widely circulated messages on social media platforms that the Army would be deployed in COVID-19-hit areas of Mumbai and Pune, the cities worst-hit by the
infection in Maharashtra.
The state government quickly denied any such move, while cyber sleuths launched a probe to track down the source of such unfounded messages.
The Mumbai police, through their official Twitter handle, said such messages were fake and appealed to people not to believe them and avoid forwarding them to other users
so as to break the chain of transmission.
During the investigation, the cyber wing was able to track down people responsible for creating and spreading such fake messages, an official said.
Stringent legal action will be taken against them, he said.
“People who circulate such fake and unverified news on social media platforms seek to cause panic among citizens and create chao. They will face stringent legal action from authorities,” the official asserted.
Clamping down on online rumours, fake news,
misinformation and hate speeches, the Maharashtra Cyber has registered 439 offences and arrested 238 persons ever since
the coronavirus-fuelled lockdown came into force in March-end, he said.
At least 183 offences were registered for forwarding objectionable WhatsApp posts and another 173 for sharing such messages on Facebook, the official added."

It is to be noted that the Supreme Court Friday sought response from the Centre on a plea which has sought a ban on the use of video communications app ‘Zoom’ for official as well as personal purposes until an appropriate legislation is put in place.
A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde issued notice to the Centre on the plea which has raised privacy concern and claimed that continued use of Zoom app is “making the users vulnerable and prone to cyber threats”.
The matter came up for hearing through video-conferencing before the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, which asked the Centre to file its reply within four weeks on the plea which has arrayed US-based Zoom Video Communications as one of the respondents in the case.
The plea, filed by Delhi resident Harsh Chugh, has also sought a direction to the Centre to carry out an exhaustive technical study into the security and privacy risks of using Zoom application.

Congress trying its best to save Nirav Modi: BJP,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/05/14/congress-trying-its-best-to-save-nirav-modi-bjp/,"May 14, 2020",PTI,Crimes,"Ravi Shankar Prasad
New Delhi: The BJP today accused the Congress of trying “its best to save” fugitive businessman Nirav Modi and cited the statement of a former high court judge, also a member of the opposition party, in the diamond merchant’s defence in a UK court.
Senior BJP leader and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Abhay Thipsay, a former judge of Bombay and Allahabad high courts, deposed as a defence witness in the case to oppose extradition proceedings against Modi by stating that the charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy against him will not stand up under Indian law.
Prasad noted that Thipsay had joined the Congress in 2018 and had met top party leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Ashok Gehlot and Ashok Chavan.
The “judge sahab” is not acting in his individual capacity but is working at the behest of the Congress, he claimed, adding that Thipsay is hardly a big name otherwise in legal circles.
“There is overpowering suspicious circumstances existing from which we can infer that the Congress is trying its best to save and bail out Nirav Modi,” Prasad said, claiming that the development has “unmasked” the opposition party which has always tried to “protect” Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksy, also a fugitive.
Indian probe agencies will mount an effective reply to Thipsay’s statement, he said.
Though Modi had fled India during the BJP-led NDA government’s rule, most of his alleged crimes pertained to the period of the Congress-led UPA rule, Prasad said and asserted that central government has acted strongly with probe agencies confiscating his assets and auctioning them.
The probe agencies have been working to bring him to justice in India, the Law Minister added.
Prasad, himself a senior lawyer, had a swipe at Thipsay, saying that he was transferred to the Allahabad High Court from the Bombay High Court 10 months before his retirement on administrative ground. “That tells its own story,” the BJP leader said.
The statement he has made in the UK court is legally unsustainable, Prasad said, calling it a “sinister attempt” of the Congress to help the arrested businessman.
An extradition request from the Indian government was certified by the UK Home Office in February last year before his arrest by Scotland Yard on March 19, 2019. The jeweller remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since then, failing to get bail despite repeated attempts.
According to the case against Modi, a number of PNB staff members conspired with him to ensure Letters of Understanding (LoUs) were issued to companies linked to him without ensuring that they were subject to the required credit checks, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions. This resulted in a fraud amounting to nearly $2 billion.

The court said the government can use online and home delivery models to sell liquor during the lockdown period. This may have shocked tipplers who celebrated the opening of shutters Thursday. But people from various walks of lives have welcomed it.
The court earlier allowed opening of TASMAC shops with severe restrictions. The norms insisted by the court included rationing by permitting one person to purchase only one bottle of liquor (750 ml) per day.
Unfortunately there was mad rush in front of these shops and social distancing went for a toss. Also number of crimes increased in the past couple of days. Even the opposition led by the DMK staged protest against opening TASMAC shops.
It remains to be seen if the order of the High Court is challenged. But be it TASMAC or even the grocery market, people should follow certain hygiene. They should carry sanitisers and wear masks. Stay a few meters away from others. A healthy environment alone can fight the deadly pandemic called corona.

This has come as a breather for many including the State police department.
Theft, robbery, murders and road accidents are not taking place. But, this has not erased the fear in minds of people even as they stay indoors day and night, a study says.
Michael L Valan, Assistant Professor from Department of Criminology and Police Administration, D G Vaishnav College conducted a study using Google Forms, “Research on Fear of Crime during Covid-19 Lockdown Period.”
The study says that 30 per cent of the population have fear of crimes such as theft, robbery, dacoity, bank frauds, online frauds, Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) or sexual victimisation.
One in three persons have fear of being victimised by any form of crime. The survey had 539 respondents from varying age groups exploring the possibility of crimes inside their houses.
The research stated that the contributing factors to fearfulness among people were: hearsay news and social media, television news, newspapers, responses from government and staying away from home.
The survey had 12 questions in four sections asking respondents about fear of being victim of crime during this time, fear of possibility of dacoity, fearful of being a victim of attack and robbery, fear of losing valuables such as laptops and gadgets or being subjected to cyber crime victimisation, as there is a surge since lockdown on people using online apps for paying bills and transferring funds.
The respondents were asked to mark from one to five, one being the least and five being highly fearful. So, how updated are the respondents on current affairs?
Among those took part in the survey, 54 per cent said they had television as their source of information, while 33 per cent relied on various apps and social media, seven per cent read news papers and 9.1 per cent gathered news through conversations from friends and families.
On an average the respondents said they spent an average of 1.78 hours on social media. Overall, 49 per cent had a fear of becoming a victim had crime.
The survey found that 22.4 per cent feared that when they go out for grocery shopping they might be robbed of their phone or wallets. 9.1 percent had substantial fear, while, 59.3 per cent had no such fear.
In some villages, a few houses were vandalised by alcoholics. Responding to such a question, 28.9 were minimally fearful and 64.3 per cent had no fear of their houses being vandalised.
Even while staying in their houses, 38 per cent expressed fear of their properties, cash, gold and costly accessories being stolen.
However, the highest fear among people was regarding net banking and online transaction of money related to credit card or bank account misappropriation. 57.8 per cent of the respondents had an overall fear, out of which 20.6 per cent were highly fearful that their bank information could be stolen.
Another 53.1 per cent said they feared being a victim of e-mail bombing, online virus attack, phishing and pornography.
Interestingly, as many as 62 percent feared being cheated by several persons and platforms asking for donations for Covid-19 relief.
Nearly, 35 per cent had fear of their belongings and properties kept at work places being damaged or stolen. Out of the 432 respondents who were married, 31.9 per cent had an overall fear of domestic violence and IPV.
To the question of female sexual victimisation during a lockdown, 32 per cent have the fear for the female members of their families being victimised.
The survey also analysed the factors contributing to fear of crime. While 55.4 per cent said hearsay news and social media was a factor, 33.9 per cent said watching televsion news added to fears. 21.1 per cent attributed it to newspaper articles, 30.3 per cent said the lack of police presence and police stations not taking complaints was a reason.
Among the survey respondents, 30 per cent were graduates, 32 per cent were post graduates, 18 per cent had school education and 11 per cent had no formal education.

The Prime Minister added: ‘It will ensure safety of our professionals. There can be no compromise on their safety!’
The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved an ordinance making acts of violence and harassment against healthcare personnel deployed in combating COVID-19 a non-bailable offence with maximum punishment of seven years and Rs 5 lakh fine, meeting a key demand of health professionals in the wake of recent attacks on them.
Asserting that the government has “zero tolerance” for violence and harassment against doctors, nurses, paramedics and other healthcare personnel, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said a person can be sentenced to anywhere between three months and five years in jail, besides a fine between Rs 50,000 and two lakh, for such crimes under the new provision.
In cases where injuries are serious, the punishment will range from six months to seven years, and carry fine between Rs 1-5 lakhs, the minister told reporters.
The ordinance will amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and the amended law will also be invoked if healthcare personnel face harassment from their landlords or neighbours over suspicion that they may carry the coronavirus infection due to the nature of their work, he said."
Cabinet clears ordinance to punish those attacking healthcare personnel; up to 7 yrs jail,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/04/22/cabinet-clears-ordinance-to-punish-those-attacking-healthcare-personnel-up-to-7-yrs-jail/,"April 22, 2020",NT Bureau,Crimes,"New Delhi: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved an ordinance making acts of violence and harassment against healthcare personnel deployed in combating COVID-19 a non-bailable offence with maximum punishment of seven years and Rs 5 lakh fine, meeting a key demand of health professionals in the wake of recent attacks on them.
Asserting that the government has “zero tolerance” for violence and harassment against doctors, nurses, paramedics and other healthcare personnel, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said a person can be sentenced to anywhere between three months and five years in jail, besides a fine between Rs 50,000 and two lakh, for such crimes under the new provision.
In cases where injuries are serious, the punishment will range from six months to seven years, and carry fine between Rs 1-5 lakhs, the minister told reporters.
The ordinance will amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and the amended law will also be invoked if healthcare personnel face harassment from their landlords or neighbours over suspicion that they may carry the coronavirus infection due to the nature of their work, he said.
An offence under the amended law will be cognizable and non-bailable, Javadekar said.
Cognizable and non-bailable offence means that police can arrest the accused, and only courts can release them on bail.
“Our government has zero tolerance against violence and harassment targeting doctors, nurses, paramedics and ASHA workers when they are doing their best to fight the pandemic,” he said.
People responsible for violence will also be liable to pay damages, which will be double the market value of the property vandalised, the Information and Broadcasting minister said.
“The government is ensuring that our health professionals can work without any tension,” he added.
Healthcare professionals have faced violent attacks in some areas during their drive to test people for suspected infection or quarantine them.
There have also been reports that their landlords or neighbours in some cases opposed their presence claiming they may be carriers of the infection.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had often condemned such cases of attacks and harassment, while lauding the role of healthcare professionals in combating the deadly disease.
Asked whether the changes in the law will be applicable even after the threat of COVID-19 is over, Javadekar told reporters that the ordinance has been approved to amend the Epidemic Act.
“But it is a good beginning,” he said, without elaborating.
Javadekar noted that Home Minister Amit Shah and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had a meeting through video conference with with a group of doctors and representatives of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) earlier on Wednesday.
The government assured them that they will be protected, he said.
The IMA, which had been demanding a law to protect healthcare professionals, called off its proposed ”White alert” and ”Black day” protests scheduled on April 22 and 23 following the meeting.
The I and B minister underlined the government”s commitment to helping health professionals involved in fighting COVID-19 by noting that it had earlier brought them under an insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh.
As of now, over 723 COVID-19 hospitals, 1.86 lakh beds and over 24,000 beds with ICU facilities have been created to deal with the pandemic, he said.
The amended law will come into effect after the President promulgates it and the government notifies it."
Banks don’t make calls to customers over EMI: Police,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/04/07/banks-dont-make-calls-to-customers-police/,"April 7, 2020",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: Even as crimes rates in the city are at all time low after the enforcement of Section 144 in order to contain the spread of Coronavirus, police say fraudsters are using the opportunity to carry out bank frauds.
As a warning to stay safe, the Cyber Crime Cell has issued an alert to the public. The notice reads, “You may receive a call asking for OTP to postpone your EMI. Fraudsters are waiting to siphon off all your money. Your bank will never ask for OTP, Pin, CVV or your net banking passwords.”
Officials of Cyber Crime Cell in the city said so far no cases have been registered. But, the alert was issued after the police got information that such fraudsters were on the prowl trying to cheat unsuspecting persons.
A police source said, “Some persons have called people asking for banking details saying the government was dispensing funds as part of coronavirus relief. Public should know neither the government nor the banks will call and ask for banking details or personal pin numbers.”
He said that the miscreants told callers that the government wanted to transfer funds through banks to avoid crowding. The fact is, the government is only giving relief fund through ration shops. The fraudsters ask for OTP or PIN numbers or send a QR code for scan.
The official said that people should be informed that banks do not call customers unless they initiate and establish contact.

"As corona cases rise, crime rates fall",https://newstodaynet.com/2020/04/06/as-corona-cases-rise-crime-rates-fall/,"April 6, 2020",Naomi N,Crimes,"Chennai: The city is at its safest ever since 24 March- This is what the police say when asked about crime rates post implementation of Section 144. It looks like coronavirus has not hit the legal businesses alone, but also the illegal ones.
Other than recording lockdown violation cases, the ‘regular offences’ such as robbery, chain snatching, mobile phone snatching, house break-ins and violence are almost at zero.
This is because everyone is inside their house and police are carrying out intense patrolling. There is no way a crime can be committed.
There is police presence every 100 meters. Take for example T Nagar- one of the largest police districts with a heavy population of families living here and it is also a commercial hub.
“As many as 20 crime cases are registered on an average day. Mostly chain snatching or mobile phone thefts. But for the past 12 days we are filing only 144 violations”, a police source said.
A Sub-Inspector of police explains, “The shops are all closed and people are inside their houses. A person cannot rob with so much policemen roaming around. Even if gold is stolen, the pawn shops are closed, so it is of no use. The TASMAC outlets are not functioning, and this has reduced a lot of Law and Order incidents. Otherwise there will be drunken brawls and domestic violence cases. Even if money is stolen there are no avenues to spend it. There is no use of committing an offence right now.”
Even areas where rowdyism is normally high paint a very laidback picture.
“We keep a check on where the anti-socials are located. We used to get a lot of complaints of rowdyism, family and financial disputes. However, post the lockdown only a single case of a missing mobile phone was filed,” says another officer.
But police fear and predict that there would be a spike in the cases after the lockdown is lifted
Inspector of Thirumangalam, Ravi says, areas like Anna Nagar are peaceful.
“Our whole concentration is on containing coronavirus. The City Commissioner A K Viswanathan and all Joint Commissioners and Additional Commissioners are working on implementing Section 144 effectively and combating the virus. Anna Nagar, like rest of the city, is now low on crimes.”
Interestingly, around 600 inmates from Puzhal were given an interim bail ahead of the lockdown. 
When asked how the offenders were being monitored, a police source said, “600 inmates, including 37 women will have to appear before court on 16, 19 and 24 April. They are all first time offenders, mostly family dispute cases. If they fail to appear before court, an arrest warrant will be issued.”"
Editoiral: “Interest” diversion,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/04/02/editoiral-interest-diversion/,"April 2, 2020",NT Bureau,Crimes,"A lot of other issues are getting submerged in the corona tsunami, as the newsprint, internet and television bulletins are full of Covid-19 stories. One such thing that missed the attention of many is a direction by the Delhi High Court. It has sought the response of the government on a plea for setting up designated courts to deal with violation of a law banning unregulated deposit schemes like ponzi scams. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued notice to the Delhi government seeking its stand by 22 May on the petition which also seeks appointment of a competent authority as provided under the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act, 2019.
The plea by Abhijit Mishra, a financial economist, also seeks formulation of rules for the implementation of the Act. Mishra, in his petition filed through advocates Payal Bahl and Ameet Singh, has said though the law came into effect from February last year, the Delhi government is yet to appoint a competent authority or set up designated courts as provided for under the Act. No rules have also been framed for implementation of the Act, the plea has claimed. It has contended that Mishra had made several representations to the authorities concerned, including the government and the Delhi High Court, to appoint a competent authority and set up designated courts.
However, no action was taken and therefore, he filed the instant petition, Mishra has said. He has further contended that under section 7 of the Act, ‘Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi has to appoint officers who are at the rank of Secretary to the statutory position of the competent authority’. The petition has also claimed that under section 8 of the Act, the Delhi government has to seek concurrence of the high court for setting up the designated courts which are to be presided over by a judge ‘not below the rank of District and Sessions Judge or an Additional District and Sessions Judge’. Mishra has contended that in the absence of rules for implementation of the Act, police officers don’t know the procedure to be followed for prosecution of violations of this law. ‘By virtue of the information received by the petitioner (Mishra) under the Right to Information Act from the High Court of Delhi, the Delhi government has not made any efforts towards appointment of a competent authority, constitution of designated courts and formulation of rules..,’ the petition has claimed. As the government machinery is busy dealing with corona, wrong-doings, including the white-collar crimes, should not go unnoticed.

How cops are prepared for coronavirus in Chennai,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/03/23/how-cops-are-prepared-for-coronavirus-in-chennai/,"March 23, 2020",Naomi N,Crimes,"Chennai: Besides investigating crimes and inquiring complaints, the city police now have a different task in hand– stop coronavirus from spreading.
Yesterday during the Janta Curfew, the police department worked in tandem with the civic body and hospitals. Their main responsibilty was to keep people off the road. Raja, a Sub-Inspector says, ”I have never seen something like this in my entire life”. Most of the police personnel say the public co-operated with them.
For the next few days, their main duty would be crowd controlling. Tamil Selvi, Sub-Inspector of Velacheri, says, ”We will have to ensure people do not gather in public places. Hereafter, while coming out of home, everyone will have to wear a mask. At least use handkerchief or shawl as face mask.”
About the curfew, she said that it was just doctors, nurses, hospital staff and civic body using the roads for commute. The Corporation staff were cleaning and sanitising the roads. The people were well aware and stayed indoors.
For the past few days we have been running our own campaign educating people on handwash, giving handsanitisers and asking them to keep surroundings clean. She said that even the police personnel cleaned up a few places. In some places where there are hostels and paying guest accommodation, many of them are unable to travel back to native places such as Maharashtra and Karnataka.
”We asked the hostel owners not to pressurize them into leaving”, she says. Even the petitioners coming to the police stations are being made to wash hands with soap on coming in and leaving. But what about the security for police who are working day and night?  Sathya, a Sub-Inspector at Vepery station says, ”Firstly, we are not scared of it. Some stations have asked women police not to come for duty. We are taking precautions and wearing masks all the time and washing our hands.”"
Asia Pacific banks lag in integrating fraud compliance functions: FICO survey,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/03/06/asia-pacific-banks-lag-in-integrating-fraud-compliance-functions-fico-survey/,"March 6, 2020",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: A recent survey by global analytics software firm FICO has revealed that only 18 per cent of Asia Pacific (APAC) banks have a strategic plan to fully integrate their fraud and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance functions, even though 71 per cent say that convergence will improve the ability to stop fraud and financial crimes.
This puts their planning efforts significantly behind that of their Western peers. In an earlier survey commissioned by FICO in 2019, 24 per cent of US banks and 47 per cent of UK banks had strategic plans to fully integrate functions. FICO estimates that 80 per cent of the functionality to do fraud checks and AML checks on a new account opening is the same.
The survey found that most Asia Pacific banks (38 per cent) are instead actively looking at a more tactical approach, actively sharing resources where synergies exist. Examples of this being the sharing of data, controls or staff. Just 12 per cent of banks in both the US and UK said they were pursuing this approach.
‘What we are seeing in Asia Pacific is most likely the fast-follower mentality coming through,’ said FICO’s Compliance Lead in Asia Pacific, Timothy Choon. ‘Many banks in region are closely watching those who are making the change overseas to see what lessons they can learn from first-movers before embarking on a similar program of change.’
When asked about current levels of integration, most banks in Asia Pacific admitted they currently had siloed operations. In terms of which areas currently operated separately or had low levels of collaboration, 95 percent nominated controls, 94 percent detection systems and 91 percent investigative systems, the survey said."
How do white collar criminals evade justice?,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/02/22/how-do-white-collar-criminals-evade-justice/,"February 22, 2020",Mohammed Rayaan,Crimes,"Chennai: In recent times, several cases of bank loan frauds have flooded the headlines. In nearly every major scams, it can be noted that the accused have always evaded justice – making the system or law that holds such rule breakers accountable – appear weak.
According to a report published by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), it said frauds have been predominantly occurring in the loan portfolio, both in terms of number and value. The report declared that Private Sector Banks (PSB) accounted for a bulk of frauds reported in 2018-19 – 55.4 per cent of the number of cases reported and 90.2 per cent of the amount involved.
However it added, ‘Incidents relating to other areas of banking viz., card/internet, off-balance sheet and forex transactions, in terms of value, have reduced in 2018-19.’
Major scandals
Reading such reports reminds one of major scams that brought India’s banking system under the scanner. In September last year, customers of Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) bank were in for a shock when RBI imposed operational restrictions for six months after PMC was found to have given over Rs 6,700 crore loans to HDIL through fraudulent means.
Likewise, in October 2016, ICICI Bank-Videocon scam came into spotlight after a whistleblower raised concerns over shady loan deals. And who can forget the flamboyant liquor baron Vijay Mallya’s loan defaults of over Rs 10,000 crore to Indian banks or Nirav Modi’s dramatic escape to UK after getting involved in scam worth $1.4 billion?
Modus Operandi
The RBI report found that ‘the modus operandi of large value frauds – that account for 86.4 per cent of all frauds reported during the year in terms of value – involved diversion of funds by borrowers through various means, mainly via associated or shell companies, accounting irregularities, manipulating financial or stock statements, opening current accounts with banks outside the lending consortium without a no-objection certificate from lenders and devolving of Letter of Credits (LCs).’
Lesser known scams
While people are often aware of billionaires tricking the system and escaping justice, there are also ‘several lesser known criminals’ who slip from law enforcers’ grip. Take for instance, Ranchi-based businessmen, Mohit Narsaria and Narayan Narsaria. According to media reports, the total current debt taken by their firms, KN Narsaria Pvt Ltd and Narsaria Construction Pvt Ltd alone has exceeded over Rs 22 crores with Bank of India. The brothers have failed to pay electricity bill amounting more than Rs 10 lakh and other taxes. Mohit Narsaria has previously been accused of money laundering, fraud, harassment, among others.
Additional loans in crores has been taken directly in their individual names through Bank of India, UCO Bank, and other private banks. In the last five years, these companies have defaulted multiple times in repayment of their loans to the bank. In 2016, the Bank of India’s risk team had flagged the account as Non-performing Asset (NPA). Reports say that each of the default incidents and non payment of installment issue was done away with insider ‘setting’ with bank and the account was allowed to be restructured without proper risk assessment or auditing of collaterals and security.
Evading justice
Reading such shocking details makes one ask, how do such criminals escape police detection? The RBI report warned that the frauds show ‘lack of adequate internal processes, people and systems to tackle operational risks.’
Financial research scholars, Geetika Sood and Meenu Bala in their study, ‘White Collar Crimes in India‘ published by the International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development, explain, ‘After committing the crimes most of the offenders get away without getting any punishment because there are not enough laws to deal with such kind of crimes.’ There investigations state, ‘In many cases, because of the supreme political connections most of the offenders get away without any punishment. Moreover, in many cases there are no witnesses for the said offences as such offences are committed in private.’
Several financial experts also believe that RBI’s power of monitoring the performances of PSBs should be tightened and conducted regularly. They also suggest slapping severe punishments to those who get involved in axis of money’s evil."
UN confirms 22 killed in Cameroon massacre,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/02/17/un-confirms-22-killed-in-cameroon-massacre/,"February 17, 2020",PTI,Crimes,"Libreville: A massacre in an anglophone region of Cameroon left up to 22 villagers dead including 14 children, the UN said, with an opposition party blaming the killings on the army.
Armed men carried out the bloodshed on Friday in the village of Ntumbo in the Northwest region, James Nunan, a local official of humanitarian coordination agency OCHA, told AFP on Sunday.
”Up to 22 civilians were killed, including a pregnant woman and several children,” Nunan said, adding that 14 children under age 18 — including nine under age five — were among the dead.
Eleven of the children were girls, said Nunan, head of OCHA’s office for the Northwest and Southwest regions, which are home to the West African country’s large English-speaking minority.
Separatists in the regions have been fighting the central government for three years.
The Movement for the Rebirth of Cameroon, one of the country’s two main opposition parties, issued a statement saying: ‘The dictatorial regime (and) the supreme head of the security and defence forces are chiefly responsible for these crimes.’
A key figure in the separatist movement, lawyer Agbor Mballa, in a Facebook post also accused ”state defence forces” of carrying out the killings.
The three-year conflict between anglophone forces seeking to break away from French-speaking Cameroon has claimed more than 3,000 lives and forced more than 700,000 people to flee their homes.
Friday’s killings followed elections on February 9 that were marred by violence in the regions blamed both on separatists and security forces."
Impeachment trial sees acrimonious scene,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/01/22/impeachment-trial-sees-acrimonious-scene/,"January 22, 2020",PTI,Crimes,"Washington: The US Senate has started the historic impeachment trial of President Donald Trump amidst an “acrimonious scene” among the Senators from the ruling Republican party and the opposition Democrats over the rules of the game.
The impeachment trial began on Tuesday and comes nearly a week after the House of Representatives, where the Democrats enjoy a majority, voted to send articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate.
In a 228-193 vote, which was mainly on party lines, the House had appointed seven impeachment managers to argue Democrats case for removing Trump from the office. The managers – Congressmen Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Jason Crow, and Sylvia Garcia – were named by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The 435-member House on 18 December charged Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanors” and impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential Democratic rival for the current president in the 2020 elections. President Trump’s lawyers submitted a trial brief Monday calling his impeachment by the House ‘a dangerous perversion’ of the US constitution and demanding his immediate acquittal by the Senate. On Tuesday, the Senate started the historic trial in “utter acrimony” as the debate was a technical one about the rules and procedures to govern the trial, the The New York Times reported.
Trump’s close-ally Mitch McConnell laid out ground rules that would block subpoenaing key witnesses or documents while each side makes its case — potentially crippling prosecutors’ arguments. Flexing his solid 53-47 majority, the Republican Senate leader also made clear he would summarily block any Democratic attempts to change his rules.
“The basic structure we’re proposing is just as eminently fair and even-handed,” McConnell said. Adam Schiff, the leader of the House impeachment managers prosecuting Trump, countered that the process ‘makes no sense’ for a trial, and was designed instead to ensure evidence is never heard and Trump is exculpated.
Political experts say that Trump is likely to emerge victorious as his Republican party enjoys majority in the Senate. This is only the third time in American history that a US President is facing impeachment trail in the Senate. Confident of the end result of the impeachment trial, Trump was in Davos to attend the annual meeting of World Economic Forum, where he met the leaders of various countries including, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The White House said that the Democrats were a joke and they have no case at all. “The Democrats are an utter joke – they have no case, and this latest political stunt proves it. The idea that the Counsel to the President has to turn over protected documents and confidential information is ludicrous, and to imply he can’t represent the President of the United States in an impeachment proceeding is completely absurd,” White House Deputy Spokesperson Hogan Gidley said.
The Democrats charged the Republican leadership in the Senate of being biased and not fair. “The public realises how unfair the McConnell proposal is, and the pressure that we have put on them and on Republican senators has gotten them to change,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. This was rejected by the GOP leaders. “This initial step will offer an early signal to our country: Can the Senate still serve our founding purpose?” McConnell said."
Former US MP gets 2 years imprisonment,https://newstodaynet.com/2020/01/18/former-us-mp-gets-2-years-imprisonment/,"January 18, 2020",PTI,Crimes,"NEW YORK: A former congressman who was one of President Donald Trump’s first supporters was sentenced to two years and two months in federal prison after admitting he helped his son and others dodge $ 800,000 in stock market losses when he learned that a drug trial by a small pharmaceutical company had failed.
Christopher Collins, 69, was sentenced by US District Judge Vernon S Broderick in Manhattan after the Republican pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and lying to law enforcement officials. Collins broke down and apologized to his family and his former constituents and colleagues.
“I stand here today as a disgraced former member of Congress,” he said. “My life has been shattered.” The sentence came even after Collins’ lawyers argued he was sorry and should face no prison time in the insider trading case. Prosecutors, however, argued he should go to prison for nearly five years.
They said Collins and his son, Cameron, were worth a total of $ 35 million when they conspired to sell shares in a pharmaceutical company before devastating news was made public. The trading, prosecutors said, enabled Cameron Collins and friends to dodge $ 800,000 in losses. Collins’ attorneys urged the judge for leniency, citing his contrition, advanced age, charitable works and a low chance that he would commit any more crimes.
“This is a sad and tragic day for Chris and his family,” defence attorney Jonathan Barr said. “He stands before you humbled, penitent and remorseful.” Collins had represented western New York since his election to the state’s 27th Congressional District in 2012. He resigned when he decided to plead guilty to a single conspiracy count, leaving the district’s constituents without representation in Congress. Prosecutors faulted Collins for campaigning for a reelection race he won after his arrest and then continuing to serve.
They said Collins learned that Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd., whose board he sat on, had failed a drug trial when he received a telephone call while he attended the annual Congressional Picnic at the White House on 22 June, 2017. Knowing that Innate’s stock would plunge when news got out, Collins “from the White House lawn” tried to reach his son to tip him off so he could sell his shares, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors said he then conspired with family members to claim Cameron Collins and friends sold shares because they were spooked by a temporary halt in the trading of the stock rather than because they knew the stock price would fall 92 per cent for the company headquartered in Sydney, Australia, with offices in Auckland, New Zealand. Assistant US Attorney Max Nicholas disputed the defense claim that the crime was the result of a tragic and emotional moment when Collins wasn’t thinking straight after learning the drug trial failed.
The prosecutor noted there was a 10-month gap between his first crime when he called his son and the second when he lied to the FBI, which described as Collins “doubling down.” “We do not agree this crime was emotional,’ Nicholas said. Broderick called it baffling that Collins would exercise such poor judgment when he and his son had the financial means to deal with any loss. ‘I have a difficult time reconciling that,” the judge said.
“It was a stupid, impulsive action that doesn’t make sense,’ Barr, Collins’ defence attorney, responded. ‘He really thought this company had something that was going to be a magic bullet for somebody with a really serious illness.”"

On Friday, Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora, who was hearing a plea by one of the four death row convicts in the case, Mukesh Kumar Singh, seeking postponement of the date of his execution scheduled for 22 January, issued fresh death warrants.  Earlier in the day, the Tihar jail authorities sought issuance of warrants against the four convicts.
Public Prosecutor Irfan Ahmed told the court that Mukesh’s mercy plea was rejected by President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday. The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of 16-17 December, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before being thrown out on the road.  She died on 29 December, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. Her sacrifice should save more and more women from crimes."

CHENNAI: While there is an alarming rise in the crime rate in and around Porur, the residents of Ramapuram have come up with a precautionary method to safeguard the residents. The Kurinji Nagar House Owners’ Welfare Association installed a number of 75 CCTV IP (Internet Protocol) cameras with 5 MP resolution.
The installing ceremony was conducted in the locality recently. It was inaugurated by Deputy Commissioner of Police. This operation of IP cameras in Kurunji Nagar cover the First and Second Main Roads and 10 connecting crossroads, which is approximately half a square kilometre area. All these cameras are connected to a centralised system located at the association office.
The association organized a grand ceremony for the launch of CCTVs. Officials from police department, corporation, metro water, electricity board, representatives and office-bearers of the various residents’ welfare associations attended the function. They also congratulated the office bearers of the association who completed the task within a short span of two months.
POLICE PRAISES
Deputy Commissioner of Police, D Ashok Kumar was the chief guest of the ceremony. He inaugurated the operation of the CCTV cameras. During his speech, he highlighted how the police department has solved several difficult cases through CCTV camera footage and given the statistical account of reduction in crime rate in Chennai with the help of CCTV footages.
The increase in crimes in our city can be blamed on migrants from other states. They stay here for a while, scan the locality, indulge in theft and later vacate the place. In such cases, “CCTV footages are of great help,” said the police department
RESIDENTS HAPPY
“It is satisfying to know that someone is there to back us up. Now, we also want to co-operate with the members and help them with their various initiatives, many of which are eye-openers to the residents here. We will support the association with their mission in the future too,” said a resident of Mangala Nagar, Kumudha.
STUDENTS STAND HIGH
School students in Kurinji Nagar involved in raising awareness about CCTVs by enacting skits. They performed well and received appreciations from residents. Mementoes were given to all participants."
United Nations condemns abuses against Myanmar’s Rohingya,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/12/28/united-nations-condemns-abuses-against-myanmars-rohingya/,"December 28, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"File photo of Rohingya refugees
UNITED NATIONS: The UN General Assembly approved a resolution on Friday strongly condemning human rights abuses against Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, including arbitrary arrests, torture, rape and deaths in detention.
The 193-member world body voted 134-9 with 28 abstentions in favour of the resolution which also calls on Myanmar’s government to take urgent measures to combat incitement of hatred against the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan states.
General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding but they do reflect world opinion. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya to be ‘Bengalis’ from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless, and they are also denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.
The long-simmering Rohingya crisis exploded on 25 Aug, 2017, when Myanmar’s military launched what it called a clearance campaign in Rakhine in response to an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. The campaign led to the mass Rohingya exodus to Bangladesh and to accusations that security forces committed mass rapes and killings and burned thousands of homes.
Myanmar’s UN ambassador, Hau Do Suan called the resolution ‘another classic example of double-standards (and) selective and discriminatory application of human rights norms’ designed ‘to exert unwanted political pressure on Myanmar’.
He said the resolution did not attempt to find a solution to the complex situation in Rakhine state and refused to recognize government efforts to address the challenges. The resolution, the ambassador said, “will sow seeds of distrust and will create further polarization of different communities in the region.
“The resolution expresses alarm at the continuing influx of Rohingya Muslims to neighbouring Bangladesh over the last four decades, now numbering 1.1 million including 7,44,000 who arrived since August 2017, “in the aftermath of atrocities committed by the security and armed forces of Myanmar”.
The assembly also expressed alarm at an independent international fact-finding mission’s findings ‘of gross human rights violations and abuses suffered by Rohingya Muslims and other minorities’ by the security forces, which the mission said ‘undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law’.
The resolution called for an immediate cessation of fighting and hostilities.
It reiterated “deep distress at reports that unarmed individuals in Rakhine state have been and continue to be subjected to the excessive use of forces and violations of international human rights law, international humanitarian law by the military and security and armed forces”.
And it called for Myanmar’s forces to protect all people, and for urgent steps to ensure justice for all rights violations.
The resolution also urged the government “to expedite efforts to eliminate statelessness and the systematic and institutionalized discrimination” against the Rohingya and other minorities, to dismantle camps for Rohingyas and others displaced in Rakhine, and “to create the conditions necessary for the safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of all refugees, including Rohingya Muslim refugees”."

SEOUL: A South Korean court rejected a request to arrest a key ally of President Moon Jae-in who is being investigated over allegations of corruption and power abuse, saying he was unlikely to flee or destroy evidence.
But in a rare comment on a suspect who has yet to be convicted, the Seoul Eastern District Court stated that the case of former Justice Minister Cho Kuk involved criminal acts of bad nature.
Prosecutors have claimed that Cho, while serving as Moon’s senior secretary for civil affairs in 2017, abused his power by blocking a government inspection into corruption allegations surrounding former Financial Services Commission Director-General Yoo Jae-soo, another official close to Moon’s ruling party.
Yoo, who later became vice mayor of the city of Busan, was arrested in November and indicted earlier this month over suspicion that he received around 49.5 million won ($42,600) in bribes from businesspeople during his time at the financial regulator.
Cho, once considered a future presidential contender for the ruling liberals, is being separately investigated over allegations of financial crimes and academic fraud surrounding his family that led to the arrests of his wife and other relatives and sparked huge protests that dented the popularity of Moon’s government.
“The nature of the criminal acts in this case is not good, but considering the suspect’s testimony and attitude during the hearing, the fact that his spouse has been arrested and is on trial on a different case, the fact that it’s difficult to determine that the gravity of the offense would warrant an arrest, and that the suspect has a fixed residence, it cannot be said there’s a reason for an arrest based on concerns of fleeing”, the court said in a statement.
Prosecutors didn’t immediately say whether they would make further requests for Cho’s arrest. Moon’s office said it respects the court’s decision to reject the warrant and criticized prosecutors for what it described as an unreasonable attempt to arrest Cho. Blue House spokeswoman Ko Min-jung didn’t specifically comment on the court’s assessment of Cho’s alleged crimes.
The (Blue House) office of the senior secretary for civil affairs has stated several times already that it carried out routine duties based on political judgment and decisions, Ko said in a briefing.
Cho served as Moon’s justice minister for a month before resigning in October as the scandal grew, but he has firmly denied any legal wrongdoing. I have been enduring an endless investigation by the prosecution targeting my family. It has been a harsh time, Cho told reporters on Thursday as he arrived at the court for a hearing on the prosecution’s warrant request.
He said he didn’t agree with the content of the prosecution’s warrant request, which accused Cho of abusing his power as a presidential official. Prosecutors in October arrested Cho’s university professor wife, Chung Kyung-shim, who has been indicted over her suspected involvement in dubious private equity investments and faking materials to help their daughter’s admission to a medical school in Busan.
Cho’s resignation as justice minister came after huge crowds of his supporters and critics marched in South Korea’s capital for weeks, showing how the monthslong saga deepened a political divide.
Moon’s liberal Minjoo Party and his supporters have accused the prosecution of pushing an excessive investigation out of resistance to government reform plans for the justice system that had been laid out by Cho, which include curbing prosecutors’ investigative powers.
But the allegations surrounding Cho have clearly struck a nerve in a country that’s struggling to tackle widening inequality and brutally competitive school environments and damaged the reformist image of Moon, whose economic failures and faltering diplomacy with North Korea have also raised alarm for the liberals ahead of April’s parliamentary elections."
Review: ‘Hero’ – Vigilante entertainer,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/12/21/review-hero-vigilante-entertainer/,"December 21, 2019",Mohammed Rayaan,Crimes,"Several vigilante films have been made in Tamil cinema and almost every iconic classic in the list is directed by Shankar. PS Mithran’s Hero may perhaps join this list as the filmmaker takes a leaf out of Shankar’s magic recipe. Starring Sivakarthikeyan in the lead role as Sakthi, Hero is a family entertainer that keeps you engaged.
Sakthi is a forger helping students, unemployed people, and others with fake certificates. His partner in crime is Ink (Robo Shankar in his usual comical self). Sakthi also helps parents to get their children to book a college seat and earns a commission. The sequence were desperate parents seeking admission will strike a chord to the audience as providing the best education is an important duty for every mother and father.
Sakthi meets Meera (Kalyani Priyadarshan), a volunteer whom he falls for. However, their romance isn’t shown much and it is restrained to just a song and few humourous scenes. When Meera accuses him of his crimes, Sakthi justifies by speaking about corruption in the system with a brief flashback. However, Sakthi has a change of heart when he decides to truly help without money, Ivana – a sister-like-figure in his locality to secure college admission.
But things don’t go the way they plan. Sakthi comes across Ivana’s ‘master’ Sathyamoorthy (Arjun acting a similar role of the character Krishnamoorthy in 1993 hit flick, Gentleman). When Sathya explains Sakthi the difficulties of succeeding in India’s education system, his reasons are bound to make you leap with wolf whistles.
The dialogues are witty. It is absolutely clear that Mithran admires Shankar’s rags-to-riches/vigilante movies and it works wonders as Hero holds our hands with issues that plagues our nation from poor education, governance, injustice in legal bodies to lack of resources in villages. It sheds light on how a lack of creativity leaves us as job seekers rather than job creators.
Sakthi’s spirit breaks when his idea to change the system is stopped by Mahadev (Abhay Deol), a super-rich powerful man who thrives on halting creative people’s innovation. He hoards crores of money at colleges and lobotomies those who oppose him. As the movie reaches the climax, it becomes a cat and mouse game between Sakthi and Mahadev.
Though Mahadev gains upper-hand in many sequences, Sakthi gains limelight when he urges all parents to check their children’s rough notes to know their hidden creativity in a final showdown. With heart-pumping background music by Yuvan Shankar Raja, Hero is an immense entertainer worth watching with family."
Special police stations for cyber crime in all districts of Tamilnadu,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/12/21/special-police-stations-for-cyber-crime-in-all-districts-of-tamilnadu/,"December 21, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: The cities of Chennai and Coimbatore are safe for women, Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) M Ravi has said today.
Ravi, who heads the special wing for crimes against women and children, said since cyber crimes will be a major problem in the future, special police stations to address these issues will be set up in all districts of  Tamilnadu. ”Special courts will be set up if the necessity arises,” he said.
Recently, taking part in an event to promote the Kavalan SOS app, introduced by the Tamilnadu police, Ravi said women can even kill someone in self defence.
”A few changes are being made in the app to make it all the more easy to use. So far 10 lakh people have downloaded the app and four lakh have registered their details,” he said.
He also said that it is wrong to find faults with the dress which women wear. The Tamilnadu police began a crackdown on child pornography a few weeks ago.
Sources said in four districts – Chennai, Chengalpet, Coimbatore and Trichy, the cyber crime police was monitoring and tracking IP addresses of people who were sharing and uploading child pornography.
Recently, Christopher Alphonse Raj (42) of Khajapet in Trichy was arrested under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
Police then conducted inquiry with 30 people who were part of the social media group run by Christopher.
Sources said that police had identified 1,500 IP addresses that were involved in the creation, storing and distribution of materials that depict sexual acts on children over the internet."

Washington: US President Donald Trump in a scathing letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to halt impeachment proceedings against him by the lower chamber of the Congress, which is all set to start the process with a debate today.
“This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of the American legislative history,” Trump said in a letter to the Pelosi.
Asserting that the Articles of Impeachment introduced by the House Judiciary Committee are not recognisable under any standard of constitutional theory, interpretation or jurisprudence, Trump said they include no crimes, no misdemeanours and no offenses whatsoever.
“You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment,” said Trump, who is the third American president to be impeached.
“By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution and you are declaring an open war on American democracy,” he said.
Trump said he had been deprived of basic constitutional due process from the beginning of this “impeachment scam” right up until the present.
“I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses, like the so-called whistleblower who started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made,” he said.
“Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us. In other words, once the phone call was made public, your whole plot blew up, but that didn’t stop you from continuing,” he added.
Trump said she and her people on committees have long said impeachment must be bipartisan- it is not. “You said it was very divisive it certainly is, even far more than you ever thought possible and it will only get worse,” he said.
“This is nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth. You are not just after me, as president, you are after the entire Republican Party,” he said.
“But because of this colossal injustice, our party is more united than it has ever been before. History will judge you harshly as you proceed with this impeachment charade,” said the US President.
“Perhaps most insulting of all is your false display of solemnity. You apparently have so little respect for the American people that you expect them to believe that you are approaching this impeachment somberly, reservedly, and reluctantly,” he said.
Trump said since the moment he won the elections, the Democrat Party has been possessed by “impeachment fever”.
“There is no reticence. This is not a somber affair. You are making a mockery of impeachment and you are scarcely concealing your hatred of me, of the Republican Party and tens of millions of patriotic Americans,” he said.
“The voters are wise, and they are seeing straight through this empty, hollow, and dangerous game you are playing,” he said.
“I have no doubt the American people will hold you and the Democrats fully responsible in the upcoming 2020 elections. They will not soon forgive your perversion of justice and abuse of power,” said the president.
“There is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens. It is time for you and the highly partisan Democrats in the Congress to immediately cease this impeachment fantasy and get back to work for the American people,” he said.
“While I have no expectation that you will do so, I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record,” Trump said."

Blaming porn sites for the rising incidents of sexual crime against women, Kumar, in his letter to Modi, expressed his ”pain and serious concern” over the increasing number of gangrape cases which have agitated the general public.
”It will be my request to take appropriate action to ban all porn sites and inappropriate content available on internet immediately after giving due consideration to the serious issue,” he wrote.
Kumar also wrote that people, especially children and youths, are watching porn, violent and inappropriate content on internet due to its unlimited reach to them. The incidents (of gang rape and crime against women) take place in some cases because of the impact of these sites, he added.
”People make videos of heinous acts (rape) against girls and women and get them uploaded on social media such as Whatsapp, Facebook etc. Such content, which seriously affect the minds of children and youths, have been found as factors responsible for crimes (against women),” he said.
Long-term use of such content negatively affect the mind of some people, which gives rise to social problems and increases the number of cases of crime against women, the Chief Minister said.
Talking about the laws meant to regulate inappropriate content, Kumar said that though certain provisions have been made in the Information Technology Act, 2000 (such as amendment in 2008), but they have not been proved effective to deal with the issue.
The Supreme Court has also given several guidelines to the government on the issue. It is time for the government to act tough on such in appropriate sites."
Democratic lawmaker Jerry Nadler slams Donald Trump,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/12/16/democratic-lawmaker-slams-trump/,"December 16, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Photo file of Jerry Nadler
WASHINGTON: A key Democratic lawmaker said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s misconduct amounted to “a crime in progress” that threatens US democracy, as the full House prepares for a historic vote on impeachment. “Do we have a constitutional democracy, or do we have a monarchy, where the president is unaccountable?”
Representative Jerry Nadler asked on ABC”s “This Week.” “That’s what’s at stake here.” He expressed anger with Senate Republicans who said they had already made up their mind to exonerate the president — even without hearing evidence or testimony — in the Senate trial expected next month.
When the Democratic-controlled House convenes Wednesday to weigh the two charges approved by Nadler”s Judiciary Committee, Trump is expected to become only the third US president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 just before a House impeachment vote. Neither Johnson nor Clinton was convicted in the Senate. Trump is counting on the Republican majority in the Senate to exonerate him.
In repeated tweets Sunday he mocked a process that, to judge by his frequent tweets, appears to consume him. He retweeted one conservative commentator as saying: “The President did nothing wrong here. There is no crime,” before adding: “Impeachment Hoax!” Some influential Senate Republicans have suggested they have already made up their minds and don”t need to hear the evidence compiled by House Democrats in several weeks of hearings.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has promised “total coordination” with the White House and said there is no chance Trump will be convicted. And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, told CNN, “I”m not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here,” dismissing the charges against Trump as “partisan nonsense.” House impeachment manager Democrat Adam Schiff, appearing on ABC alongside Nadler, called Graham”s attitude “disgraceful.”
And Nadler said McConnell and Graham would be defying the oath required of all senators in an impeachment trial: “to do impartial justice.But Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said Sunday that Democrats had come up with “zero evidence” of the “high crimes and misdemeanors” the US Constitution sets as the standard for impeachment. “I think this is the beginning of the end for this show trial that we’ve seen in the House,” he told ABC’s “This Week.”
Nadler, however, painted a dire picture of what is at stake. “This president conspired — sought foreign interference in the 2016 election,” he said, referring to Russian meddling. “He is openly seeking foreign interference in the 2020 election” by asking Ukraine to investigate Trump”s Democratic rivals. “We cannot permit that to continue,” he said, adding that to allow such behavior would be “a subversion of the constitutional order.” Sunday evening, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer released a letter to McConnell, putting forward the structure for a Senate impeachment trial that would begin the week of 6 January.
Schumer also proposed issuing subpoenas for several senior White House officials, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security advisor John Bolton. “Conducting the trial according to this plan will allow the public to have confidence in the process and will demonstrate that the Senate can put aside partisan concerns and fulfill its constitutional duty,” Schumer wrote.
One of the two impeachment articles to go before the House charges Trump with abuse of power for conditioning military aid and a White House meeting on Ukraine’s launching investigations into Democrats ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The other charges him with obstructing Congress for refusing to cooperate with the inquiry and ordering other officials not to appear, a development Democrats say is unprecedented in American history.
The impeachment hearings have been a sometimes grim exercise for Democrats, who fear moderate members of the party from Trump-friendly districts could lose their seats next year if they vote to impeach. One Democrat, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who has been a vocal opponent of impeachment, is expected to switch allegiance to the Republican Party in coming days. He reportedly held a long meeting with Trump on Friday."

"Over 1,500 rape cases registered in Kerala",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/12/10/over-1500-rape-cases-registered-in-kerala/,"December 10, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Thiruvananthapuram: Over 1,500 rape cases have been registered in Kerala so far this year, according to police statistics.
The numbers have been revealed at a time when there is a nationwide uproar over increasing crimes against women after the recent killing of two young women in Hyderabad and Unnao in Uttar Pradesh respectively.
In Hyderabad, a young veterinarian was gang-raped, killed and set on fire by four men, while in Unnao a rape victim died after being set ablaze by her attackers.
According to the police’s crime records bureau, a total of 10,516 cases of atrocities against women have been reported up to September this year, of which 1,537 were rapes.
Though there is a slight dip in the number of rape cases this year compared to the 2,015 last year (provisional figures), it could go up when the cases in the rest of the months are taken into consideration.
Besides the rape cases, a total of 3,351 molestation, 167 kidnapping and abduction, 309 eve-teasing cases, four dowry deaths and 2,019 cases of cruelty by husbands and relatives have also been reported in the first nine months this year, it said.
A total of 2,003 and 1,656 rape cases had been reported in Kerala in 2017 and 2016 respectively, it added.
Kerala Women’s Commission Chairperson M C Josephine said fast-track courts, speedy trial and women-friendly police stations besides grassroots level awareness drives are the solutions to address the increasing atrocities against women.
However, she said compared to many other northern states, cases are registered in the state fast and it was a positive sign in a way.
“Delayed justice is a cause of worry in the cases of atrocities against women. Justice delayed amounts to justice being denied to the victims,” Josephine told PTI.
“It prompts people to think and act emotionally. That’s what we saw in Telangana recently,” she said.
So, fast-track courts should be set up. Trials should be expedited and stringent punishment should be ensured to the culprits, the Women’s Commission chairperson said.
Despite stringent laws, women are facing new forms of crimes and atrocities nowadays, she pointed out. “Five women have died in petrol attacks in Kerala in the last six months,” she said.
The feudal mindset of the society which doesn’t like women coming to the mainstream also has a role in the harassment faced by them, she added.
The Women’s Commission recently wrote to the State government to make police stations more women-friendly and create an awareness among sleuths on the necessity to be more empathetic while dealing with complaints of women, Josephine said."

New Delhi: Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal today wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that rapists be hanged within six months of their conviction.
Stressing that implementation of laws is important, she demanded that police resources be increased and their accountability fixed.
”Merely making the law is not enough, it will also have to be implemented. You are requested to immediately implement the law of death sentence for all rapists in six months and all the necessary mechanisms should be started for this,” she said.
Citing the incidents of the gangrape and murder of a Hyderabad veterinarian and the brutal rape of a six-year-old girl in Rajasthan, she said, ”Daughters are falling prey to such heinous crimes in every corner of the country”.
”These two daughters are not with us, but their screams are not letting us sit in peace. The soul trembles even thinking how much pain they must have suffered.”

”DCW is the only women’s commission in the country which works on Sundays and Saturdays and day and night as well. But even after doing so, if the daughters are raped, then it all seems meaningless,” she said.
Maliwal was supposed to start a hunger strike this morning to press for her demands but she claimed police did not allow her to do so. Police said they were waiting for her to send details of the protest."

She said, ”377 websites have been taken down and 50 FIRs filed.” Sathyananth cited recent incidents of sexual assault of minor girls to seek complete ban on Internet and social media carrying such content so as to ”save our children.”
She said there are rising crimes against children due to easy access to pornography. Irani said she would have the administration act immediately if details of incidents are provided.
In a separate Zero Hour mention, G V L Narasimha Rao (BJP) raised the issue of English being made a medium of education up to Class VIth in Andhra Pradesh saying the move undermines regional languages and should be reviewed.

Alert: Someone is looting money from your bank account,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/11/21/alert-someone-is-looting-money-from-your-bank-account/,"November 21, 2019",Bhavani Prabhakar,Crimes,"Representative image
Chennai: While technology has brought people close in terms of networking and connecting, it is a bane when it comes to fraudulent activities. In the last months, there has been alleged increase in money swindling incidences.
Recently, the Anti-Bank Fraud Wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) nabbed an auditor for allegedly deceiving of Rs 32 lakh after hacking an NRI’s account in Dubai. However, bank frauds are not a one-off incident.
Sindhuja was one of the recent victims of the act. She was in for a surprise when she realised that Rs 12,000 had been debited from the account linked with her number after receiving a spam call.
Narrating the incident, Sindhuja, who works as a telecaller in a private company in the city, recalled, ”I got a call from a North Indian who kept muttering for about a minute or two and I could not make any sense. Soon after I disconnected, I received an alert on my mobile that Rs 12,000 has vanished from my account.”
”I immediately took the matter to the bank officials and received a temporary refund and was promised of a permanent one after a month,” she said.
Similar was the case for Prakash, but he was quick enough to realise that it was a fraudulent activity and disconnected the call within a few seconds and escaped from the cyber attack.
With the rise of cyber crimes in India, experts are worried about the lack of effective enforcement and minimal conviction rate. Researchers in the field advocate the usage of a basic handset for the mobile number linked with the bank and avoid spam calls.
Speaking on the issue, Supreme Court of India Advocate and Cyber Laws Expert, N S Nappinai said, ”The IPC and IT Acts are more than enough to cover the banking frauds. However, the problem is not with the availability of laws or sufficiency of knowledge, the police and judiciary force for the last 20 years are being trained in the sector. It is an on-going process and capacity building is being undertaken extensively across the country. While this is a pedagogic process, the need of the hour is effective enforcement of the mandate. The conviction rate and the complaint registration percentage is abysmally low in cyber crime cases in India.”
Echoing similar thoughts, DG Vaishnav College Criminology department Assistant Professor, Michael Valan stated that the unreported cases of financial swindling are higher.
He pointed out the lack of separate classification of bank frauds in India. Giving an instance, he said, ”Forgery cases in money extortion and other situations fall under the same category which cannot provide solution to hoaxes.”
Elaborating on the usage of applications to commit such crimes, he said, ”Google is an open source and cannot have a hold on the number and types of apps introduced. There is also a dearth of experts in the police force. There is no centralised cyber crime policy.”
Explaining the need to nab offenders, Nappinai elaborated, ”Until the criminal is nabbed and jailed, he is not going to be deterred from committing an offence. The low registration rate indicates the lack of confidence in the system.”
”The pace at which such cyber crimes, including bank frauds, are dealt with, is slow than normal. We cannot rely only on electronic trails which work in the case of international-level.”
A police source stated that there is an increased level of awareness among general population about cyber crimes and added that the department receives more number of online harassment cases.
”Precautionary measures should be taken when people engage in doing online transactions,” added the source.
According to reports, it may also be noted that the State has received a fund of Rs 28.97 crore to build 40 cyber crime police stations and six cyber labs to handle the increasing number of offences."

Al-Qaeda offshoot wiped out from Kashmir: DGP,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/10/23/al-qaeda-offshoot-wiped-out-from-kashmir-dgp/,"October 23, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Srinagar, Oct 23: The Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed is trying to coordinate with other groups in Kashmir to carry out attacks, Jammu and Kashmir’s police chief said today, while announcing that the Al Qaeda’s offshoot, the Ansar Ghazwatul Hind, has been wiped out from the Valley.
Director General of Police Dilbag Singh was addressing a press conference a day after security forces killed three militants in south Kashmir’s Tral area.
“The AGH has been wiped out but some elements who are overground workers (OGW) are there. They suddenly crop up and join militant ranks… But, as of now, the AGH has been wiped out from Kashmir,” Singh said.
The three militants killed in Tral have been identified as Hameed Lone alias Hamid Lelhari, Naveed Ahmed Tak and Junaid Rashid Bhatt, all residents of Pulwama district.
“All the killed terrorists as per police records were part of the Zakir Musa group and were wanted by law for their complicity in a series of terror crimes, including attack on security establishments and civilian atrocities,” the DGP said.
Singh said the group of militants was working closely with the JeM.
“The JeM is trying to coordinate with every militant group in Kashmir. The JeM and the Lashkar-e-Taiba get their direction from Pakistan on who to target, what type of violence to incite and at which level,” he said.
“So the JeM and the LeT are both trying to coordinate with every group. If you remember, two Gujjar brothers were killed in Tral and Pakistani militant Yasir of the JeM was involved in that. He was in contact with this group,” Singh added."

Mayawati’s reaction comes after National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) released the annual crime data for 2017 after a delay of more than a year. The data said that with 3.59 lakh FIRs, crimes against women rose for third year in a row and the maximum cases were registered in Uttar Pradesh (56,011).
“The National Crime Records Bureau has presented the statistics of crime in front of the country and world after a long delay. They naturally have made big headlines in the media and they are definitely not improving the image of India, which is a matter of great sorrow and concern,” Mayawati tweeted.
“These statistics make it clear that in all kinds of crime in the country, especially in the matter of women’s safety, the central and state governments are in dire need to do a lot with full honesty.

Monohar Lal Khattar ridicules Sonia’s appointment as Cong chief,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/10/14/monohar-lal-khattar-ridicules-sonias-appointment-as-cong-chief/,"October 14, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"File photo of Manohar Lal Khattar
Sonipat/New Delhi: Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar ridiculed Sonia Gandhi’s return as the Congress chief, using a Hindi proverb that seemed to call her a ”dead mouse” and provoking an outrage from the opposition party.
Addressing a poll rally at Kharkhoda near Sonipat on Sunday, Khattar mocked the Congress effort at finding a replacement for Rahul Gandhi as the opposition party ended up picking someone from the Gandhi family again.
”Khoda pahad, niklee chuhiya,” he said, using a proverb that suggests big effort but little gain. Literally, it means finding a mouse after digging a mountain. “That too a dead one,” Khattar added.
The Bharatiya Janata Party leader had targeted both the Congress and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) at the meeting, days ahead of the 21 October Assembly polls in the state.
”You know the kind of ”tamasha” these family-based parties are doing. Now, within the family too, fights are taking place. On one side there is ”Pappu”, and on the other Mummy,” he said.
The Congress has demanded an immediate apology over the mouse remark.
“The Chief Minister’s remarks are inappropriate, he stooped to the lowest level and it also shows the anti-women character of the BJP,” the Congress tweeted.
On Monday, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev and Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja slammed Khattar.
Khattar had said the Congress took three months to look for a national president outside the Gandhi family after Rahul Gandhi announced his resignation.
”We thought it was a good thing that they were moving away from dynastic rule,” he said, referring to the Congress leader as “pappu Choudhary” and “Rahul baba”.
But the Congress ended up choosing Sonia Gandhi, he said, referring to her appointment as interim president. ”Again the same Gandhi family. Khoda pahad, niklee chuhiya, woh bhi mari hui.”
Sushmita Dev said Khattar’s remarks are a clear reflection of his and the BJP’s disrespectful attitude towards women.
“We in the Congress are committed to upholding the dignity in public life. But as a woman, I take offence to the disgraceful remark made and demand an unconditional apology,” she said.
She accused him of lowering public discourse in an attempt to divert attention from real issues like joblessness and acute economic slowdown.
Kumar Selja asked the chief minister to reflect ”in what light remarks such as these portray women of Haryana and elsewhere.”
”It is because of the mindset of people like you that Haryana has come to be known as the crime capital, which tops the country in crime. Crimes against women are on the rise,” she said.
At another poll rally week ago, Khattar had accused the Congress of sympathising with terrorists and said Sonia Gandhi “sheds tears for militants”.
In Sonipat, he also took potshots at the Congress over the exit of its state unit chief Ashok Tanwar, who quit the party after alleging that bribes were being paid for tickets to fight elections.
On the Congress manifesto, Khattar said, “They have promised freebies for which Rs 1.25 lakh crore will be needed, which can never be fulfilled. They are making promises as if the state’s coffers are their ‘baap ka maal’ (their father’s property).”
He also targeted the JJP, formed after a split in the Indian National Lok Dal.
“This party, Jhootee Jhagda Party, will become the Jamanat Jabt Party as its candidates will lose badly,” he said, predicting that JJP candidates will lose their deposits.
He called JJP leader Dushyant Chautala a “gappu”, saying he just talked big."
"Lalithaa heist: Special teams head to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/10/05/lalithaa-heist-special-teams-head-to-andhra-pradesh-karnataka/,"October 5, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: Special teams of police have left for Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to nab the mastermind of the Lalithaa Jewellery heist in Tiruchi.
According to sources, the teams are searching for Murugan (44), a habitual offender who has been arrested by Chennai and Hyderabad police in the past for robbery and other crimes.
Police are looking out for him in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. In 2018, he had formed his own gang with an aim to strike at banks and jewellery shops, sources added.
He was arrested for the first time for a crime by Bengaluru police.
Police said, after he came out on bail, he shifted his base to Hyderabad and bought a house.
He told his neighbours that he was a film producer. ”He wanted to carry out robberies to invest in film making,” sources stated.
In August 2014, he carried out a robbery in Balan Nagar and Mehboob Nagar in Andhra Pradesh. He was later arrested and the police seized huge amount of gold and cash from him.
After this, he was again arrested in 2017 by the city police for robbing 17 houses in Thirumangalam, Anna Nagar. He was arrested along with four of his accomplices and five kilograms of gold was seized from him.
Police said, when Murugan plans to execute a robbery, he refrains from staying in a house or in a hotel. Instead, he keeps travelling in a van or a car.
He also does not use a mobile phone, which makes it all the more difficult to trace him. Murugan, sources say, has many health issues. It is also said he had adopted two differntly abled children.
A native of Thiruvarur, he also has the support of his village people who would not give police any details about him as he also helps many families in need.
It may be noted that two men wearing a dog mask and another a cat mask gained access into the jewellery store at Chathiram after drilling a hole in the wall.
They stole 800 pieces of jewellery which weighed over 100 kilograms worth Rs 13 crore. Police arrested one of the accused, Manikandan on Thursday night."

Pakistan condemns Jaishankar’s statement on PoK,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/09/18/pakistan-condemns-jaishankars-statement-on-pok/,"September 18, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Islamabad: Pakistan on Tuesday called on the international community to take “serious cognizance” of India’s aggressive posturing about taking physical jurisdiction’ of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, saying such “irresponsible and belligerent” statements from New Delhi have the potential to further escalate tensions and seriously jeopardise peace and security in the region.
Pakistan’s statement came hours after India said PoK is its part and one day it expects to have “physical jurisdiction” over it and asserted that there is no need to “worry” too much beyond a point about what people will say on Kashmir as it is an internal issue on which its position has “prevailed and will prevail.”
Addressing his first press conference after assuming the office in the Modi 2.0 government in May, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also hit out at Pakistan, saying India has a “unique challenge” from one neighbour and it would remain a challenge until that neighbour becomes a normal neighbour and acts against cross-border terrorism.
Asked about remarks by some Union leaders that henceforth talks with Pakistan would be only about Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) and not on Kashmir, Jaishankar said, “our position has, is and will always be very clear on PoK, that it is part of India and we expect one day we will have physical jurisdiction over it.”
Reacting to Jaishankar’s statement, Pakistan said it calls on the international community to take “serious cognizance of India’s aggressive posturing” on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Such “irresponsible and belligerent” statements from India have the potential to further escalate tensions and seriously jeopardise peace and security in the region,” Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement.
“We strongly condemn and reject the inflammatory and irresponsible remarks” made by the Indian External Affairs Minister regarding Pakistan and PoK. These remarks are an obvious manifestation of India’s utter frustration over the continued international censure of its egregious human rights violations in Kashmir,” the statement said.
India cannot divert international attention from its crimes against the innocent people of Kashmir blaming Pakistan. Pakistan stands for peace, but would be ready to respond effectively to any act of aggression, the statement said.
Instead of resorting to jingoistic rhetoric, India must rescind its illegal actions, stop forthwith grave human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, refrain from violating international law, and fully comply with UN Security Council resolutions for a final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, the statement added, Tension between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on 5 August.
Reacting to India’s move on Kashmir, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its “internal matter.” New Delhi has also asked Islamabad to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric."
Australia blocks websites hosting Christchurch attack videos,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/09/09/australia-blocks-websites-hosting-christchurch-attack-videos/,"September 9, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Representative image
Sydney: Australia ordered internet providers today to block eight websites that published content linked to the Christchurch mosque massacre — a first under new censorship rules.
After the alleged gunman, an Australian national, live-streamed the killing of 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March, Canberra has looked to expand its censorship powers. The overseas websites were blacklisted because they “continue to provide access to the video of the Christchurch terrorist attacks or the manifesto of the alleged perpetrator”, said Julie Inman Grant, Australia’s eSafety commissioner.
Authorities refused to name the websites — which will be blocked for at least six months — saying it could bring them more traffic. Several other websites were asked to take down content and had complied, Inman Grant added. “The remaining rogue websites need only to remove the illegal content to have the block against them lifted,” she said.
One of the eight websites was a blog focusing on the so-called “Threat of Islam”, according to an explanatory statement lodged with the Federal Register of Legislation. The Communication Alliance — a telecommunications lobby group — said internet providers had already blocked all eight websites voluntarily before the order, but welcomed the legal clarity provided by the government decision. In defence of the new censorship powers put into action by Australia’s conservative government, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last month: “That type of abhorrent material has no place in Australia.”
“We are doing everything we can to deny terrorists the opportunity to glorify their crimes, including taking action locally and globally.” A new 24/7 Crisis Coordination Centre is also being set up, tasked with monitoring terror-related incidents and extremely violent events for censorship."

Addressing the top brass of police organisations during the 49th Raising Day event of the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) here, the home minister said usage of forensic evidence is the need of the hour for police investigators to clinch convictions against criminals.
Shah said he has asked BPRD to prepare a plan to create “modus operandi bureaus” at the national and state levels and that the government is mulling making forensic evidence essential in all criminal cases where the quantum of punishment is seven years or more.
“The conviction ratio is very pitiful in the true sense. It cannot go like this in these times. This needs to be corrected and this can only be corrected when a probe is supported by forensic evidence.”
“If a charge sheet is supported by forensic evidence, then there are not many options before the judge and the defence lawyer. Automatically, the prosecution ratio will improve,” Shah said.
The Bureau of Police Research and Development under the home ministry is tasked with preparing and suggesting better working policies and technology solutions for the police forces and act as a national think tank on policing."

PM Modi uses I-Day address to make major announcements,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/08/15/pm-modi-uses-i-day-address-to-make-major-announcements/,"August 15, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Modi hoisting tricolour at Red Fort
New Delhi: In his first Independence Day address after returning to power with a bigger mandate this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today announced creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff to spearhead the three services, called for measures to check ‘population explosion’ and gave a fresh push to the idea of ‘one nation, one election’.
Addressing the nation from the ramparts of Red Fort, Modi pitched abrogation of Article 370 as a step towards ‘one nation, one Constitution’, saying a new approach was needed as the special provision for Jammu and Kashmir failed to yield desired results in 70 years.
His nearly 95-minute-long address was marked by a host of significant announcements as the Prime Minister said his government, in its second term, will work towards fulfilling people’s aspirations and dreams after meeting their needs in the last five years.
Modi also touched upon a host of other issues including tackling terrorism, corruption, poverty, environment and ease of living.
With his government facing criticism for increasing taxes for the affluent class, Modi sought to assuage them, saying those creating wealth must be respected as wealth distribution can happen only when wealth is created.
In his sixth consecutive Independence Day address , Modi also announced rolling out of ‘Jal Jivan’ mission to provide piped drinking water to all households and said his government will spend Rs 3.5 lakh crore for it.
Donning a colourful safa, the Prime Minister referred to BJP’s big win in the general election and said his government’s return to power showed how despair had given way to hope with people believing that the country can change for the better after seeing his dispensation’s first five years of work.
“The period between 2014-19 was about fulfilling people’s needs. Now is the time to meet their aspirations and dreams,” he said.
Announcing the major step of appointment of Chief of Defence Staff, a recommendation made after the Kargil War, Modi said it will ensure synergy among the three services and provide effective leadership to them.
“Our government has decided to have a Chief of Defence Staff – CDS. It will help all three services to walk together as the country can no longer afford to work in silos,” Modi said, adding India has to keep pace with the changing world.
A high-level committee set up to examine the gaps in the country’s security system in the wake of the Kargil War in 1999 had called for appointment of a Chief of Defence Staff as a single-point military adviser to the Defence Minister.
A group of ministers that analysed required reforms in the national security system had also favoured appointing a CDS.
The Prime Minister said his government has taken several key steps since coming to power less than 10 weeks back and cited the law against instant triple talaq, making stringent provisions in law on sexual crimes against children and reforming medical education sector.
“If we can take steps against ‘Sati’ custom, female foeticide, child marriage and dowry, then why not against instant triple talaq?” he asked, justifying the decision to abolish triple talaq.
On revoking provisions of Article 370 and Article 35(A) in Jammu and Kashmir, he said, “We neither nurse problems nor let them fester.”
“Why didn’t those who are supporting Article 370 make it a permanent provision for Jammu and Kashmir. Why did they keep it as a temporary measure?” he said
Raising the issue of simultaneous polls for Lok Sabha and Assemblies, he said discussions should now be held on ‘one-nation one-election’ as it is imperative to make the country ‘great’.
On Goods and Services Tax, he said it brought to life the dream of ‘one nation, one tax’ .
Voicing concern over ‘population explosion’, the Prime Minister said it leads to many difficulties and there was need for the Centre as well as State governments to launch schemes to tackle it.
Modi said people should be more aware about the issue and ensure that they are able to fulfil the needs of the children they are bringing into this world.
Talking about making people’s lives easier, he said his priority was to ensure ‘ease of living’ with the government having minimal role in people’s lives.
“Let our people have the freedom of pursuing their own aspirations, let the right eco-system be made in this regard,” he said.
Modi said his government will invest a massive Rs 100 lakh crore for developing modern infrastructure that will aid in nearly doubling the size of the Indian economy to $ 5 trillion in the next five years.
He said reforms will continue to be ushered in to help India break into top 50 countries on the ‘ease of doing business’ ranking.
“To some, the target of nearly doubling the size of Indian economy to USD 5 trillion in five years may seem difficult. But when we have in five years (of BJP rule) added USD 1 trillion as compared to USD 2 trillion size achieved in 70 years of Independence, then this target is achievable,” he said.
Modi said political stability through a massive mandate for his government alongside predictable policy provides a unique opportunity for India to grow.
“The country shouldn’t lose this opportunity,” he said, adding that his government has provided high growth while keeping inflation low."
Fair & lovely,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/08/14/fair-lovely/,"August 14, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Observing that the possibility of the CBI being used as a ‘political instrument’ remains ever present, Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi posed a question on Tuesday, “Why is that whenever there is no political overtone to a case, the agency does a good job?” Gogoi said efforts should be made to ‘delink crucial aspects’ of the CBI from the overall administrative control of the government.
Delivering the 18th annual D P Kohli memorial lecture, organised by the agency after a hiatus of two years, Gogoi said, “The CBI should be given statutory status through legislation equivalent to that provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).” D P Kohli was the founder-director of the CBI.
The legal mandate of the CBI must be strengthened by having a comprehensive legislation addressing deficiencies relating to organisational structure, charter of functions, limits of power, superintendence, and oversight, Gogoi said.
Listing out ‘imminent concerns’ before the agency, he said as superintendence and control of the agency continues to, in large measure, lie with the executive by virtue of Section 4 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act 1946, the ‘possibility of it being used as a political instrument’ remains ever present. “I have no doubt that there is more than enough strength within the organisation to deal with any such situation,” he said.
He said many recommendations of the judiciary to reform the functioning of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have been accepted as it is by the Central government. “However, given the entrenched afflictions, the current challenge is to ascertain how to make the CBI functional as an efficient and impartial investigative agency fully motivated and guided by the objectives of service to the public at large, upholding the constitutional rights and liberty of the people, and capable of performing in increasingly complex time,'” he said.
The CJI categorised the ‘crucial concerns’ regarding the CBI under five heads — legal ambiguity, weak human resources, lack of adequate investment, accountability and political and administrative interference. Underlining legal ambiguities in the functioning of the CBI, the CJI said in order to conduct investigation into a State, consent of the State is crucial.
“Given vested interests or bureaucratic lethargy, such consent is often either denied or delayed, severely compromising the investigation,” he said. Gogoi said a patchwork of legislation governing the functioning of the CBI adversely affects inter-institutional coordination, both horizontally and vertically.
“The result of multiplicity of institutions results in an aggressive competition for scarce resources and inter-institutional ‘turf-war’,” he said. Further, to address an increasing incidence of inter-State crimes, an argument could be made for including ‘public order’ in Concurrent List, for the limited purposes of investigating such crimes. However, he cautioned that autonomy without accountability would endanger the very objectives that animated the formation of the institution. The CJI has made valid points and the government should ensure that the CBI remains a neutral and fair agency."
"Hyderabad temple launches Jatayu Army for protection of girls, women",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/08/14/hyderabad-temple-launches-jatayu-army-for-protection-of-girls-women/,"August 14, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Hyderabad: The famous Chilkur Balaji shrine here on Tuesday symbolically launched a programme to form a ‘Jatayu Army’ on the temple premises to prevent atrocities on women and girls.
‘Jatayu‘ is the divine giant eagle that dies while fighting Ravana to prevent him from abducting Goddess Sita in the mythological epic Ramayana. Special rituals were performed on sacred threads that were tied on the wrists of women and girls in the shrine, which marked the symbolic launch of ‘Jatayu Sena’an army for protection of girls and women, Chilkur Balaji temple head priest, C S Rangarajan said. Several male devotees took oath to serve as members of the Jatayu sena, he said.
“Men can join to become members of the Jatayu sena and they need to be proactive in preventing crimes against girls and women,” he said. The idea (for launching the ‘Jatayu Sena‘) came from thousands of devotees who have been a part of a sensitisation campaign, he said.
Rangarajan said the temple continues to sensitise society towards protecting girls and women from molesters and eve-teasers. “Jatayu Army formation is the new initiative, to protect women and girls from atrocities..we cannot allow any more rapes…Jatayu Army is the only solution,” he said.
On the occasion, temple priests felicitated Nadeem of Karwan area here who rescued a minor girl from being abducted on a two-wheeler by a man near Moinabad Mandal, recently. Those joining Jatayu Army can help in protecting women and girls from atrocities and also in preventing them from abuse, Rangarajan said, adding he is taking suggestions from devotees on how to take the initiative forward.
Popularly known as ‘Visa Balaji Temple’,the shrine is situated on the banks of the Osman Sagar lake near here and is one of the oldest temples. Expressing concern over incidents of rapes of children in the country, temple priests in June this year had performed prayers to prevent such crimes."

Malaysian lawmaker sorry for proposed ‘anti-seduction law’,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/08/01/malaysian-lawmaker-sorry-for-proposed-anti-seduction-law/,"August 1, 2019",Agency,Crimes,"Kuala Lumpur: A Malaysian lawmaker apologised Thursday after his proposal for legislation to protect men from being “seduced” by women into committing sex crimes such as rape sparked a storm of criticism.
Mohamad Imran Abdul Hamid, a senator from the country’s ruling coalition, made the comments during a debate in parliament’s upper house Wednesday.
“I propose… a sexual harassment act to protect men from the actions, words and clothing of women, which can cause men to be seduced to the point they can commit acts such as incest, rape, molestation, (watching) pornography,” he was cited as saying by local media.
“This is important, we (men) need to be protected. The actions, clothing of women can seduce us into breaking the law.”
The retired admiral’s remarks drew swift criticism from campaigners in the Muslim-majority country and the leader of his own People’s Justice Party, Anwar Ibrahim, called on him to retract them. Mohamad Imran apologised and withdrew his proposal: “Although my intention was sincere, I did not expect it to be perceived as a huge mistake that offended many women and men as well.”
Women’s rights campaigner Marina Mahathir was among those criticising his comments, saying they went “over the line”. “He’s giving excuses for men behaving badly,” the activist, who is also the daughter of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, told AFP.
“It just points to the type of toxic environment that women in politics, and in other areas, have to live in.”
Women’s rights group Sisters in Islam tweeted that sex crimes were “despicable”, adding that “men must be held accountable if they commit these crimes, regardless of what women wear”.
It is not the first time the lawmaker has found himself in hot water — in 2015 he was criticised after warning in parliament against athletes dressing in a “sexy” fashion at sports events."
Data breaches cost Indian firms Rs 12.8 crore: Report,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/07/24/data-breaches-cost-indian-firms-rs-12-8-crore-report/,"July 24, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"New Delhi: Data breaches cost organisations in India about Rs 12.8 crore on average between July 2018 and April this year, according to a report sponsored by tech giant IBM.
The global average total cost of data breach was $3.92 million (about Rs 27.03 crore) with the average size of the breach being 25,575 records.
In India, the per capita cost per lost or stolen record was at Rs 5,019, compared $150 per record globally. On an average, 35,636 records were compromised in a data breach in India that ranked 15th in terms of total cost of breach.
The findings are part of the 2019 Cost of a Data Breach Report, conducted by the Ponemon Institute, and sponsored by IBM Security.
For the report, the Ponemon Institute interviewed over 500 organisations that have experienced a breach between July 2018 and April.
The analysis takes into account cost factors from legal an regulatory activities to loss of brand equity, customer turnover and the drain on employee productivity.
The report said major causes of data breaches in India comprised malicious or criminal attacks (51 per cent), system glitch (27 per cent) and human error (22 per cent).
The mean time to identify the data breach has also increased to 221 days from 188 days, while the mean time to contain such breaches has decreased to 77 days from 78 days.
According to the report, data breaches in the US are vastly more expensive – costing $8.19 million (about Rs 56.46 crore), or more than double the average for worldwide companies in the study. Costs for data breaches in the US increased by 130 per cent over the past 14 years of the study, up from $3.54 million in the 2006 study.
Malicious data breaches cost companies in the study $4.45 million on average. This is over $1 million more than those originating from accidental causes such as system glitch and human error, the report said.
Inadvertent breaches from human error and system glitches still accounted for nearly half of the data breaches in the report, costing companies $3.5 million and $3.24 million, respectively.
Also, for the ninth year in a row, health-care organisations had the highest cost of a breach – nearly $6.5 million on average (over 60 per cent more than other industries in the study).
The report found that the effects of a data breach are felt for years. While an average of 67 per cent of data breach costs were realised within the first year after a breach, 22 per cent accrued in the second year and another 11 per cent accumulated more than two years after a breach.
The longtail costs were higher in the second and third years for organisations in highly-regulated environments, such as health care, financial services, energy and pharmaceuticals, it added.
“Cybercrime represents big money for cyber criminals, and unfortunately that equates to significant losses for businesses,” global lead for IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services, Wendi Whitmore, said.
“With organisations facing the loss or theft of over 11.7 billion records in the past three years alone, companies need to be aware of the full financial impact that a data breach can have on their bottom line – and focus on how they can reduce these costs,” Whitmore said.
“India is witnessing a significant change in the nature of cyber crimes, it is now extremely organised and collaborative. The cost of data breach continues to grow,” Security Software Leader-India/South Asia, IBM, Vaidyanathan Iyer, said."
Telangana councillors will be disqualified on failure to ensure green drive,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/07/20/telangana-councillors-will-be-disqualified-on-failure-to-ensure-green-drive/,"July 20, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Hyderabad: Among the citizen-friendly initiatives passed in the Telangana Municipalities Bill, 2019, yesterday were self-assessment of property tax and action or disqualification on elected members if they failed to ensure survival of 85 per cent of plants under the green drive.
Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao moved the bill. If unauthorised buildings were constructed without permission through online facility on an area of upto 500 sq metres with a height of the ceiling at 10 metres, they would be demolished without any notice.
Also self-certification for paying property tax. If a landlord is found to have furnished wrong information, a penalty of upto 25 times would be given. The CM said such claims would be verified by flying squads, under the supervision of district collectors.
Urban poor can now construct a house on a small plot without having to apply for permission from the municipality, and they would have to pay a house tax of only Rs 100 per annum. But to get civic facilities, these people will have to register with the municipality at a nominal charge of Re 1.
The chief minister also stressed on the importance of growing plants and trees. The bill said that municipal chairperson must constitute a green cell and earmark 10 per cent of funds in the budget toward the initiative. The chairpersons need to take up plantation in his/her ward. But if they failed to ensure survival of 85 per cent of the plants, they would be disqualified.
In an aim to eliminate corruption, government employees working at the same place for years can be transferred. Also new door numbers would be given to each house with a QR code to curb crimes.
The chief minister said people contesting in local body elections must read the new legislation. There would be only municipalities and municipal corporations and no other urban local bodies. The number of municipalities and municipal corporations in the state would be 128 and 13, respectively.
Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader M Bhatti Vikramarka, who spoke on the bill, said the spirit of democracy and ‘Gram Swarajya‘ should not be lost with the Collectors being given powers over elected representatives. Rao, however, said the government does not intend to take away the powers of local bodies.
According to the Bill, the preparation of electoral rolls for and the conduct of elections to all municipalities in the state shall be under the superintendence, direction and control of the State Election Commission. All elections to Municipalities shall be held under the supervision and control of the State Election Commission. For this purpose, the SEC shall have the power to give such directions as deemed necessary to the commissioner and director of municipal administration and other officials.
It further said the schedule for the elections shall be communicated by the state government to the SEC after having decided the date of notification and date of conduct of election, including the date of election for the post of chairperson or Mayor and vice-chairman and other such members. TRS working president K T Rama Rao, who had an informal interaction with mediapersons, welcomed the Act, saying it would root out corruption and promote transparency.
Meanwhile, the BJP in the State slammed the Act alleging that many provisions were against the basic structure of the Constitution. The party urged Governor E S L Narasimhan to send back the Act. The Municipalities Act 2019 has made the State Election Commission a puppet in the hands of the government, alleged BJP. The Act is contrary to Article 243 ZA (2) of the Constitution of India, and Section 195(1) of the Act takes away the powers of the State Election Commission and takes away discretionary power of SEC for fixing dates."

Chennai: Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami today said law and order is maintained well in the State and the government will not hesitate to take action against anyone who violates it.
Speaking during the debate on demand for grants for Police and Fire & Rescue Services Department, Palaniswami said it is usual for crimes to happen during the tenure of any government.
“But this has considerably reduced now and Tamilnadu police have received best police award. The Police Department cannot be held responsible for the mistakes done by some individuals. The same officials who were present during the DMK rule are only present now. People do not have to fear for their safety,” he said.
During the discussion, DMK MLA I Periaswamy said proper arrangements were not made to assist idol wing special officer Pon Manickavel.
He said, “This government is boasting of identifying idol thefts. But you are not even able to bring the Natarajar statue from Australia.”
Responding to this, Palaniswami said Pon Manickavel has been given all the assistance he wanted. “Pon Manickavel has been asked by the court not to make any arrest independently. He has been provided vehicles and equipment. Apart from this, 204 officials have been appointed in the idol wing,” he added.
Periaswamy also said it was inhuman to arrest anti-alcohol activist Nandini just before her marriage.
Law Minister C Ve Shanmugam replied to this and said Nandini was not arrested by the police but it acted according to the verdict of a court.
“Nandini has come out on bail and has got married,” Shanmugam added.
Palaniswami also announced that new houses will be built for police personnel in 10 districts. The insurance cover for health check-up of police personnel will be increased to Rs 3 lakh.
Earlier in the day, Leader of the Opposition, M K Stalin, brought a calling attention motion seeking to exempt the State from NEXT exam. Stalin said it is the right of the State government to run medical colleges and this should not be given up.
“The State government should oppose the Central government’s NEXT exam,” he said. Replying to this, Health Minister C Vijayabaskar said the State government is also against NEXT.
“The Union government sought the opinion of holding NEXT exams and the State government has rejected it by saying it is against federal rule,” he said.
Tenure of local body officials extended
Municipal Administration Minister S P Velumani today tabled a draft bill extending the tenure of the special officers for civic bodies for another six months till 31 December. This bill was opposed by the Opposition parties.

Panchayat Union school in Kannagi Nagar has high enrolment rate,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/06/30/panchayat-union-school-in-kannagi-nagar-has-high-enrolment-rate/,"June 30, 2019",Naomi N,Crimes,"Chennai: Although there are four government-run schools located close to each other in Kannagi Nagar, it is the Panchayat Union Primary School, that has the highest enrolment rate.
On a cloudy afternoon, the campus which is located close to the Kannagi Nagar police station, is abuzz with sounds of children chattering and playing. A teacher silences them, but the effect lasts only for a short while.
Students of classes one to five study here with meagre facilities. As of now, 868 of them have been enrolled for the new academic year, even as the number is expected to hit 900.
According to Parvathy, a teacher, “There are two reasons as to why this school is preferred more than the other institutions. This is the only English-medium one and also, the teachers are good; we give the children individual attention.”
800-odd students are squeezed into just 16 classrooms, where everyone, including those who teach, are seated on the floor.
“The ones aged above 50 use chairs, while others sit down along with the students,” she said.
Due to the lack of adequate rooms, classes take place in the school’s ground, while the Principal’s cabin doubles as a computer classroom. But none of these take away the charm of this place.
“We have had many good-hearted persons come and volunteer with us. A person called Vishwanathan of Sairam Trust supplies breakfast for the little ones on working days, a retired bank staff, Chidambaram, takes spoken English classes, while another resident Lakshmipathy, takes Karate sessions. Yoga is also taught here. But all of these extra-curricular activities are done free of cost,” she said.
The credit for the Panchayat Union Primary School’s popularity, goes to Headmistress Jayabharathi, it is said. “I joined the school in the December of 2011. The strength was just 325. The following academic year, we started English medium. Soon, the enrolment rate started climbing and we got permission from the education department to introduce a separate uniform for English medium, with consent from parents. This spiked the strength,” she recalled.
“It was a struggle to ensure that students come regularly and not drop out, as sometimes they neglect classes saying that they go need to go for work, along with the rest of the family. Also, while some caretakers have been involved in crimes, others are single parents. A few other children are orphans. So in these circumstances, coming to school is a kind of awareness,” she stated.
Even as the institution has been receiving various awards, what everyone needs are classrooms.
“As of now, two classes run in the same room; which is about 80 students with two teachers at one time,” she said."
Retired top cop in Chennai gives valuable tips to parents,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/06/23/retired-top-cop-in-chennai-gives-valuable-tips-to-parents/,"June 23, 2019",S Solomon Raj,Crimes,"Chennai: Safety of children is the need of the hour, with crimes against them growing everywhere. People have to take care of their wards and keep a watch on them when they play on streets and go out. Retired Deputy Superintendent of Police, S Subramaniyan, a resident of Panneer Nagar, shares with News Today his experience in safeguarding children.
“My request to schools and parents is to teach road safety to children. I have seen many students riding bicycles and bikes on main roads of Mugappair and Anna Nagar. Busy stretches like Ambattur Industrial Estate Road, Thiruvalluvar Salai, Mugappair West Main Road and Eri Scheme First Main Road are risky spots. Sometime, they even move on wrong direction without knowing the danger for them and others.”
He further states, “Many mishaps have taken place on Thiruvalluvar Salai and Ambattur Industrial Estate Road. Cases like a lorry hitting a girl and a boy trying to overtake a bus meeting with accident happen due to ignorance of road safety. Parents allowing their children to ride bikes is one of the major reasons for accidents. I watched few school students riding triples in two-wheeler along with friends risking their lives.”
“Recently, I saw a girl playing near a burning stove with boiling oil on a vessel in a chips shop. Her parents were busy speaking on their mobiles. No one watched the child. If the child playfully touches or pushes the vessel, what will happen? I immediately get down from vehicle and took the child to safer place. Parents who noticed my action came to me immediately. I advised them to take care of their child rather speaking on mobile. I also warned the shopkeeper to install the stove in a fenced place and keep an eye around it,” the retired policeman says.

Why TN is forbidden land! — 3:  Tell-tale twists in the tongue tales,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/06/20/why-tn-is-forbidden-land-3-tell-tale-twists-in-the-tongue-tales/,"June 20, 2019",Jawahar T R,Crimes,"The writer T.R.Jawahar is Group Editor of Chennai-based News Today, Maalai Sudar and Talk Media publications.
I was pretty much certain many holy feathers would be ruffled. Why drag sacred Sanskrit into an unseemly fracas? What is the connection? It is my firm opinion that the contents of the last column, that harp on how Tamil scores over Sanskrit on several counts, are most relevant, if only to highlight the perverse ironies on parade in the present. Here is an account of the travesty of linguistic history, a lethal legacy that continues to define current politics.
Today, the veneer of inclusiveness and concern for minorities has become a diplomatic compulsion for the BJP. Having successfully and successively achieved absolute majority in LS, the toning down of the cliched pseudo-secular rhetoric can be passed off as magnanimous Rajdharma. Yet the RSS, BJP and other affiliates, their key leaders and their cultivated constituency are all genetically ingrained with Hindu Nationalism. Even in recent polls it was used to great effect, but selectively and smartly. All fine!
But the core … and sore point is that this Hindu Nationalism, that traces its roots deep into the past rides on the rath of Sanskrit. BJP’s nationalism is Sanskrit nationalism. Hindi nationalism is a by-product of this mindset, but we will come to that later. In BJP’s scheme of things, Hinduism, Hindutva, Cultural Nationalism and all such ideological expressions rest on the ‘assumed’ pre-eminence of Sanskrit in the Bharatiya, read, Indian Civilisation, to the exclusion of all other tongues and traditions, within the same Bharath. Now why should the more senior and better endowed Tamil take this lying down?
Now, one could understand if the primacy of Sanskrit was an ordained or organic development. But nothing can be far from truth. Ordained, yes, but by the British. In their view, for them to understand the Indian Hindu culture, it was essential to unravel the Sanskrit texts which were then the most visible signposts and easily available low hanging fruits. Their malignant motive was to decipher Hinduism to discredit it.
But whatever, much of their efforts and expense were directed at Sanskrit and the term ‘Indologist’ was synonymous to a foreign Sanskrit student / scholar. That Sanskrit was no longer in vogue as a spoken language did not matter. In short, Sanskrit owes its primacy primarily to the official patronage of the British, a gift from the unlikeliest of benefactor.
Tamil was not so lucky, despite its credentials in terms of chronology and cultural richness. I had mentioned in passing in the last article that researches of Tamil language and its civilisation are very nascent, around late 19th century. Even this was by zealous private individuals with only their undying thirst for knowledge and love of their mother tongue driving them. U Ve Swaminatha Iyer is the undisputed pioneer in this and his contributions are legendary. His successors and subsequent archaeological discoveries opened new windows into Tamil’s past.
The British colonialists had completely ignored Tamil research, obsessed as they were with the mistaken notion that Sanskrit is the repository of all that is Bharath. Lack of official recognition, much less patronage of Tamil, a thriving language, that has stood the test time and tide, literally, (tsunamis, climate changes, population upheavals, etc.), was a foolish, fatal injustice caused by the British not just to Tamil but to the domain of history itself. After all, this living language carries in its womb the lives and times of one the earliest, mature civilisations to have inhabited the planet.
So, while a fossilised language became the representative of a colonised nation’s culture, its most vibrant and throbbing tongue was not even allowed to wag. This head start that Sanskrit had over Tamil has proved to be very costly to the latter and its speakers, till date. The day may not be far for the tortoise Tamil to overtake the Sanskrit hare to the winning post of scientific and historic ratification, but the damage of delay lingers as a decisive denial. Here’s how.
Northern parties, netas and academics have taken much advantage at the supposed superiority of Sanskrit. They waste no opportunity to wax eloquent on the greatness and godliness of this ‘supreme’ language, vis-à-vis all other Indic languages and openly promote Sanskrit based on the unfair momentum received from the British.
In time, this lingo superiority has morphed into cultural and political superiority. Speakers who display reverence for any other language in similar vein are ignored and even insulted. It is this hangover from the British-vintage cocktail of ignorance and arrogance that is costing the BJP dear in TN, a State that holds its tongue close to its heart.
The hypocrisy of the Sanskrit-based Bharathiya proponents is apparent. They routinely question the history written by the British as one by the victors and, therefore, belittling of India’s real history. Quite fair. European imperialists resorted to such distortions of history world over to justify their colonial crimes. But while availing of the certificate of the vile British, the Sanskritwadis do not want to accord the same concession and concern to the history of other cultures and civilisations that belonged to ‘their’ cherished Bharatvarsha! In this duplicity they are being more British than the British.
After all, even the history of Tamil language and its speakers has been subdued, subverted and worse, made subservient to a rank junior. It has also been distorted and only of late the mists of time are clearing to reveal the shimmering kaleidoscope of a resplendent civilisation. Should not the proud protagonists of cultural nationalism own up this hallowed culture and give Tamil its due place as parent? Aah, It would be futile to expect them to acknowledge and accept the obvious, as that would mean swallowing their practiced pride. Clearly, Tamil will be a perennial irritation on their Sanskritic skin.
In contrast, we Tamils have always been more welcoming and cosmopolitan. We have had absolutely no inhibitions in adopting Sanskrit literature as our own, accepting many of its spiritual and religious injunctions in our life and rituals. Tamil scholars and savants have made it a point to learn Sanskrit and have translated some of the finest literatures of Sanskrit into Tamil, all with an eager intellectual openness and absolute self-confidence.
Kambar’s Ramayanam, though a translation of Sanskritic Valmiki Ramayanam, is a sterling example. And its greatness lies in the fact that though imported, it has a stand-alone merit as a classic literary Tamil work of all time. Ditto with the Bashyas of Shri Ramanuja. But translations apart, the ageless Sangam literatures of Tamil, most of the earliest ones having been destroyed by floods, are forerunners of the most ancient of Sanskrit texts.
I am obliged to mention without malice that hardly any of the great ancient Tamil works on philosophy and religion have been translated into any of the north Indian languages, let alone Sanskrit, in those early times.
Tamil also challenges Sanskrit’s monopoly over the sacred. The Vaishnavite Prabandhams and Saivite Dewaram and Thiruvasagam are the equivalent of the Vedas and other Sanskritic religious treatises in spiritual content and power, and their divinity have supposedly brought the Gods down to earth. We say this on the authority of the Alwars and Nayanmars who created these hymns in the same vein we believe the words of past anonymous Sanskrit peers. While the primal ‘Om’ has its Tamil origins too, for final salvation Tamil is as much handy as Sanskrit.
The siddhars of this land had crossed impregnable frontiers in all sciences, particularly the science of the soul, independently and even ahead of the saints of north. The holy and the irreverent, the physical and meta-physical, the weird and the wild, indeed, ideas of all kinds have found free flow in versatile Tamil. Though seemingly improper to compare, it must be said that for every Sage Veda Vyasa of yore and lore there, we have a Sage Agasthya here.
Tail piece: BJP, if it is serious about seeking political moksha in TN, would do well to start chanting Tamil’s glories, in Tamil for sure, as a penance for having enjoyed and exploited the unfair push its primary vehicle Sanskrit got very early on.

Need of the hour,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/06/04/need-of-the-hour-2/,"June 4, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"In a welcome verdict, the Bombay High Court Monday upheld the Constitutional validity of an amended section of the Indian Penal Code under which repeat offenders in rape cases can be awarded life imprisonment or death penalty. A division bench of Justices B P Dharmadhikari and Revati Mohite Dere dismissed petitions filed by three convicts in the Shakti Mill gangrape case challenging the constitutional validity of the legal provisions under which they were sentenced to death in 2014.
Under an amendment to Section 376 (e) of the IPC, repeat offenders in rape cases faced life imprisonment or death penalty. The amendment was made after the gangrape of a 23- year-old woman in Delhi in 2012. ‘We are of the opinion that Section 376 (e) of the IPC is not ultra vires to the Constitution and hence need not be quashed in the present case,’ the court said.
The petition was filed by Vijay Jadhav, Mohammed Kasim and Mohammed Salim Ansari — all sentenced to death by a sessions court in 2014 for raping a journalist in 2013. The three were also convicted for raping a call centre employee. The trials for both the crimes were held simultaneously. The trial court proceeded to pronounce the punishment in the call centre employee case and, subsequently, allowed a prosecution plea to charge the convicts under Section 376 (e). With crimes again women and even girl children on the rise, only strict punishments can bring them down. Hence, the latest verdict of the Bombay High Court is a much needed one."
Two terrorists killed in Pulwama encounter,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/06/01/two-terrorists-killed-in-pulwama-encounter/,"June 1, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Srinagar: One of the two terrorists killed in an encounter with security forces in Pulwama district on Friday was a Pakistani and the duo belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) outfit, police said today.
Four terrorists and an ‘active associate’ were killed Friday in two encounters with security forces in Shopian and Pulwama districts of Jammu and Kashmir.

Police installs CCTV cameras in most places at K K Nagar,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/30/police-installs-cctv-cameras-in-most-places-at-k-k-nagar/,"May 30, 2019",Karthikeyan Halan,Crimes,"Chennai: The presence of CCTV cameras and blinking lights near them, will make miscreants think twice before committing a crime. Hence, we have installed the third eye in almost all streets of K K Nagar, said R7 Police Inspector (L&O), V Srinivasan.
He told News Today, “Till February this year, 1,005 CCTV cameras were there at 249 locations. Now, additional 110 cameras have been installed at 25 locations taking it to 1,115 total cameras at 274 places at K K Nagr. We have have a sense of fulfilment.”

The R7 police limit covers Anna Main Road, P T Rajan Salai, Rajamannar Salai, Munusamy Salai, 80 Ft Road and Arcot Road. “We want to have CCTV cameras for every 50 metres and blinking lights near them. Seeing the lights itself, the culprits will stay away,” the Inspector said.
Srinivasan also sought the cooperation of residents welfare associations, particularly with CCTV cameras. “If they are unable to fix on their own, we can arrange for sponsors. Residents should come forward and work with the police to keep our locality safe,” he said.
The Inspector said he was ready to meet residents and the associations can arrange for the meetings so that all issues can be addressed.
Time and again, the police have been insisting on CCTV cameras, as they help them in solving crimes quickly. Instead of questioning multiple suspects and leads in connection with a crime, they can narrow down on the culprit with the help of cameras, they say.

"Chain-snatching incidents on rise in Porur, residents demand CCTV",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/28/chain-snatching-incidents-on-rise-in-porur-residents-demand-cctv/,"May 28, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: Chain-snatching incidents at Porur locality in Chennai have gone up say the residents here. The recent case where two bikers snatched a 13-sovereign gold chain from a couple last week has been condemned by many here.
“Chain snatching has become common and we have been complaining about this for a longtime. Even after a number of cases registered, no CCTVs have been installed in many of the interior stretches. More than losing our valuables, we elderly people fear for our lives,” says Ramachandran, a senior citizen living in this area.
Last week, a couple were on their way to a relative’s house at Kattupakkam when two bikers followed them and snatched the woman”s gold chain. Although she tried not to give up on the chain, her husband, who was riding the bike, lost balance and both of them fell down. The men got away with her chain. She suffered injuries on her neck and was rushed to a nearby hospital.
“Such people are playing with the victims’ lives. This couple luckily escaped with a minor injury. These culprits should be punished,” says another angry resident, Goutham.
The people in the neighbourhood are also concerned about women’s safety. “I am an IT employee and I work in alternative shifts. During nights, no patrolling is done in this area, and many streets lack proper lighting,” rues Geetha, a resident of Ramapuram.
Seeking action against these crimes, the residents say that they have been requesting for installation of CCTVs in the interior areas of Porur and also want continuous police patrolling during night time.

It’s our responsibility,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/23/its-our-responsibility/,"May 23, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Months after Abirami of Kundrathur and Dashwanth of Mugalivakkam sent shock waves across the State with their gruesome crimes – the former allegedly murdered her two children in an apparent bid to live with her lover and the latter sexually assaulted, killed and burnt the body of a seven-year-old – crimes against children are once again on the rise in Tamilnadu. Three recent incidents, all committed by parents, are far from understandable.
A five-year-old girl was allegedly beaten to death in Trichy by her mother earlier this week for watching TV for long hours. According to reports, the victim was the only child of the accused parents. The horrible incident occurred when the mother got upset with her daughter being continuously glued to the TV despite repeated warnings. The accused started beating her daughter with a leather belt all over her body. Later, the woman forced her daughter to stand outside in the scorching heat as further punishment leading her to collapse.
In another incident, the Ambattur police Tuesday arrested a 20-year-old married woman and her partner for allegedly killing her three-year-old son. The woman, married to a welder, reportedly developed relationship with a painting contractor and moved with him and her child to Menambedu in Ambattur two months ago. On Sunday, they killed the child as they saw him as a hindrance to their relationship. Neighbours told the police that they frequently witnessed Karthikeyan torturing the boy. In the third, a mother attempted suicide after strangulating her two children at Porur. A visitor to the house found the three of them unconscious and rushed them to a hospital. The children were declared brought dead, while the mother was in the intensive care unit. Children are the future of the family and the country and subjecting them to mental and physical torture calls for tough punishment."

"K’town filmmakers opt for murder mysteries, real-life stories",https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/07/ktown-filmmakers-opt-for-murder-mysteries-real-life-stories/,"May 7, 2019",M BHARAT KUMAR,Crimes,"Move over horror movies and rom–coms, it is time for crime thrillers in Kollywood. Much recently, over a dozen flicks – mostly on whodunit themes (loosely based on a few real-life incidents) – have made it to the theatres. Young filmmakers in Tamil cinema seem to have a penchant for this genre and delivered engrossing fare.
Watchman, featuring G V Prakash; K13, helmed by   Bharath Neelakantan; Jayam Ravi-starrer Adanga   Maru; Arjun Vijay’s Thadam; Vellai Pookal with  Vivek in the lead; Vishal’s Irumbu Thirai; Karthi-starrer Theeran Adhigaram Ondru; Sivakarthikeyan’s  Kaaki Sattai; Uruyadi 2; Boomerang; and Vishnu Vishal’s Ratchasan are among the few that won rave reviews.
Says Kannan, an industry tracker, “Horror stories and mass hero films have become cliched these days. They are too predictable. Audience want a change.”
“Remember, such movies have always dominated Tamil cinema. Sivaji Ganesan’s Andha Naal or Ravichandran’s  Adhey Kangalwere popular those days. In the 1980s, films like Sigappu Rojakkal, Nooravudhu Naal or  Oru  Kaidhiyin Diary made headlines. The trend is slowly coming back.”
“Films like Irumbu Thirai that spoke about digital crimes, or Theeran Adhigaram Ondru that threw light on masked robbers from north India, had a connect with the audience,” he says, and adds, “Issues that are discussed on social media inspire filmmakers to come out with movies.”
David, an ardent movie buff, says, “Today, bringing the audience to theatres is a difficult task. He has various avenues of entertainment. It is a big challenge for directors. Even big heroes’ films have flopped. Content is the key. Knowing that fully well, young directors dare to do innovative themes and crime thrillers that attract people to theatres.”
“Movies should be crisp and engaging these days. It should be little less that two hours. Handling thrillers is considered the wise thing,” he explains.
“Also, the influence of Western cinema and OTP platforms embolden young directors to try this genre repeatedly,” he adds."
Dilemma with a daughter,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/06/dilemma-with-a-daughter/,"May 6, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"“But uncle, why are you so stubborn on choosing only ‘girls college’ for your daughter? Why can’t you consider her choices too?” – I butted in through the important family talk in which discussions were going on for choosing the ‘best college’ for my cousin.
Yes, the plus-two board results were out a week back. This is that time of the year where all parents go into a huddle to choose a good college for their child.
So, coming back to our discussions, “Choosing the right college for your child is important that, too, when she is a girl. You are a journalist and I’m sure you must come across a lot of crimes against women happening in day-to-day life. At this time, I can’t risk her life by making her study in a co-education college. Girls’ college must be safer for her” – This is what a parent who is about to get a seat for her daughter in a women’s college says. Not only she but this is the mindset of a section of the people, even in Chennai.
If you are surprised let me tell you this mindset prevails among parents – yes my people, it is there.
I would say, as a parent, it is your responsibility to show the reality of the world to your child. Show them the world as it is, make them face everything, feed them the courage and fierce self-confidence to face society, and let them decide to study what they are passionate about.
Instead, what you do is cowardice. This is not about giving them a safe environment. This is about letting them balance the gender gap vs pushing them into peer pressure. I accept that there are crimes against women. But this has nothing to do with co-education college or a women’s
college.
WIDENING GAP
I am sure that everyone must be aware of this. Some engineering colleges, though being co-education, enhance the gender gap with their humiliating rules and regulations. I know colleges that don’t even allow girls and boys look at each other.
If at all they find a girl talking to a boy, both their parents are informed immediately and they are humiliated by the professors in front of everyone.
To those college managements, trust me, you are creating a huge gender gap. A relationship becomes complicated only when it was given too much importance. And this ‘gap’ is the reason for most crimes, I would say.
DID YOU DO THIS, PARENTS?
To all parents sending your daughter to college this year – sit with your child first. Make her talk about her passion, goals, life target or whatever. Let her decide what she wants. After this, give her your (genuine) suggestions. Make her know about all the choices that are available beyond the same-old engineering courses (unless your daughter really has a passion for
engineering!).
Post-discussion, if you think your daughter is choosing some risky courses, explain to her all the difficulties. Make her believe that she is responsible for her own decision and no one can be blamed in the future. Once you make her feel confident about her decision, believe me, parents, she can survive ANY situation.
She will be safe in ANY environment. She will manage ANY kind of problems. So, it’s time to spend time with your daughter.
Please note that this applies to your sons, too. The special mention about daughters is only because of the mindset of some parents that “These are courses for men”, “Women’s college is the only safe place for girls.”"
Hackers demand Rs 20 lakh to restore power sites,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/05/03/hackers-demand-rs-20-lakh-to-restore-power-sites/,"May 3, 2019",PTI,Crimes,"Hyderabad: Hackers, who attacked websites of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh state power utilities, have demanded six Bitcoins (nearly Rs 20 lakh) as ransom to give description key to restore the sites, police said today.
T Srinivas, Director (Projects and IT) of Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (SPDCL), assuring no data breach said the website of their organisation is open and that of Northern Power Distribution Company Limited is in the process of restoration.
“They (ransomware attackers) demanded six Bitcoins. Normally the attackers leave a link for paying ransom. In this case the websites were restored to normalcy even before they sent the link. We are continuing our investigation,” Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber Crimes) KCS Raghu Vir told PTI.
The official further said the link which the malware leaves for ransom cannot be traced and previous history of ransomware attacks proved they originated from Central Europe and some African nations.
Srinivas said the websites and systems are managed by TCS and experts from the IT giant have flown in to restore them.
“Our website is open now. There is no harm to the data. Our servers are secured,” he said. A staff of the Power Distribution Company of Telangana Thursday received a mail from an unknown person and when he inadvertently clicked on it, the virus (ransomware) attack took over the entire system.
Along with the Telangana systems, the computer systems of power utilities in Andhra Pradesh also came under the malware attack because they are linked to each other, police had said.
When contacted, K Vijayanand, Chairman and Managing Director of Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh Limited, said experts from TCS were working on restoration of the site and there was no impact on the billing activities for AP utilities."
No child’s play,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/04/30/no-childs-play/,"April 30, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"When a report of the Ministry of Home Affairs last year said 55,000 children were kidnapped in India in 2016, a whopping 30 per cent increase over the previous year, not many in these parts thought that such incidents were happening in their own State, till a baby kidnapping racket was busted in Namakkal recently. It all started when an audio surfaced on social media that gave way to unearthing the trafficking case.
The policemen, during inquiry, identified that a retired nurse Amudhavalli, with the aid of her husband, Ravichandran, who works as an assistant at a cooperative society, was involved in selling the babies acquired from below poverty line couples. It is being claimed that a total of 14 infants were sold by them. Soon after the inquiry, they were detained by the police. The inquiry further revealed that Murugesan, an ambulance driver attached to Kollimalai Primary Health Centre, and private nurses Parveen, Haseena, Nisha and Arulsami brokered the deal and were also arrested. The police are also trying to tracing the couple who bought the infants.
According to the 2017-18 report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, 54,723 children were kidnapped in 2016 but chargesheets were filed in only 40.4 per cent of the cases. The conviction rate in child kidnapping and abduction cases in 2016 was a dismal 22.7 per cent. As many as 41,893 such incidents were recorded in 2015 and 37,854 in 2014. A Home Ministry official had said, ‘Even though most of the lynchings in the recent past were fuelled by rumours of child lifting on social media, the statistics show that the fear of child kidnapping among people, especially those in the rural areas, is not completely unfounded.’ Children are the future of the country and crimes against them should be viewed with utmost seriousness. Strong punishment can alone put an end to such things."
Everyone’s responsibility,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/04/25/everyones-responsibility/,"April 25, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Now that the Madras High Court has lifted the ban on TikTok, users of the popular mobile application that allows people to create short lip-synced videos, are happy. But the concerns expressed by the court while banning the app on 3 April and lifting it on Wednesday still remain. The bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice S S Sundar has said it was concerned about crimes against children and warned that if any ‘controversial’ video violating its conditions were found posted on the app, it would be considered a contempt of court.
On 3 April, the HC had called for the ban on the downloading of TikTok, owing to the spread of pornographic content on the platform. The order came in the wake of allegations from several countries that the app is proving to be a fertile hunting ground for paedophiles. Using this app, users can create and share short videos with special effects. TikTok reached the one billion download mark in February. It allows users to create and share short videos with special effects and is one of the world’s most popular apps. It has been downloaded by nearly 300 million users so far in India, out of more than one billion downloads globally, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.
It has been criticised for inappropriate content that could also expose children to sexual predators. There is also a live-streaming feature that allows users to send virtual ‘gifts’ to their favourite creators, which can be bought with real money. Arguing against the ban, senior advocate Isaac Mohanlal, who appeared for TikTok, claimed that the application has an in-built security mechanism, and its machine moderation will not allow uploading of videos with obscene or nude content. At the end of the day, it is not just the duty of TikTok to prevent abusive and explicit content. The responsibility also lies with the users. It is the duty of everyone to make the physical and virtual world a safe place to live in."
10-member gang held for cheating ICICI Bank with cloned cards,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/04/25/10-member-gang-held-for-cheating-icici-bank-with-cloned-cards/,"April 25, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Hyderabad: In a shocking incident, the ICICI Bank was cheated of Rs 3 crore after a 10-member gang allegedly withdrew the money with cloned cards.
The gang members hailing from Jharkhand and West Bengal verified card numbers through e-wallets and booking application and validated PIN numbers through Interactive Voice Response of more than 3,500 bank customers.
They later used these cards to withdraw money from ATMs located across the country, such as, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Karnataka and Kerala.
Speaking to reporters, Cyberabad Police Commissioner V C Sajjanar termed this case as one of the biggest cyber crimes to happen in recent times. “This shows a paradigm shift in the cyber criminals fraudulent methods in doing frauds targeting banks itself instead of individual customers,” he said.
The police took up the case after a complaint was lodged by Regional Manager, ICICI Bank, Hyderabad on 26 March. The complaint said, during March, the bank’s toll-free customer care call centre at Hyderabad had received more than three lakh calls on IVR platform from various un-registered mobile numbers of bank accounts with a very specific request of balance enquiry by Debit card number and ATM Personal Identification Number.
Of the validated cards of more than 3,500, withdrawals took place with more than 1,000 cards amounting to more than Rs 3 crore, said the complaint.
The ICICI Bank issued a statement, that the bank has proactively informed the police about the matter and has been supporting them to book the fraudsters and that there has been no financial loss to their customers as the bank was refunding money to customers who were affected in the incident."
Lanka blasts: TN outfit denies links with National Tawheed Jamath,https://newstodaynet.com/2019/04/24/lanka-blasts-tn-outfit-denies-links-with-national-tawheed-jamath/,"April 24, 2019",NT Bureau,Crimes,"Chennai: “We are making it clear that we have absolutely nothing to do with NTJ which is being suspected. We condemn imputations suggesting links between the TNTJ and NTJ. Many have Gandhi as surnames and parties in Tamilnadu have words like Dravida and Kazhagam in their names. Does it mean that all of them have the same ideology or have links?” said Abdul Rahim, Deputy General Secretary, TNTJ.
The Tamilnadu Thowheedh Jamaath (TNTJ) yesterday denied any links with the Sri Lanka-based National Tawheed Jamath (NTJ) which is suspected to be behind the deadly blasts on Easter Sunday.
Abdul Rahim strongly condemned the bomb attacks and said that they were only hearing about the Sri Lankan namesake after the blasts and also that their outfit worked to ensure that ideology of the ISIS did not find any takers in the State.
He said that the possible reason behind the attacks was the result of a sense of frustration that they were allegedly not getting justice for crimes against their community and that such people  become a prey for extremist ideologies.
“Islam very clearly says a strong no to extremism and terrorism in any form or manner. We propagate it and guide people and youth to fight for their rights within the framework of democracy and our Constitution. Extremism cannot be an answer for extremism. It would only aggravate the situation,” Rahim was quoted saying.
The remedy for any problem has to come from the government, and the judiciary in a democratic way, he added. “The ISIS could attract youth in some parts of India, but not in Tamilnadu. It is because of our work guiding the youth on the democratic path.”
The Islamic State had yesterday claimed responsibility for the suicide attacks that killed 321 people and wounded more than 500 others in Sri Lanka."
